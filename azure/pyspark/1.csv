A Little Snowflake,K,Rhyme,"I am a little snowflake, unique and small

The Greedy Mouse,K,Short Story,"Once upon a time, there was a greedy mouse named Jerry. He lived in a small hole in the wall of a grand old house, and spent his days scurrying around the kitchen, stealing bits of cheese and crumbs of bread whenever he could.

Despite his constant thievery, Jerry never seemed to have enough. He was always looking for more and more food, and his insatiable hunger led him to take bigger and bigger risks.

One day, Jerry heard about a delicious wedding feast that was being prepared in the house. His mouth watered at the thought of all that food, and he knew he had to have it. So, he hatched a plan to sneak into the banquet hall and make off with as much as he could carry.

Jerry waited until everyone was asleep, and then he made his way to the banquet hall. The tables were piled high with every kind of delicacy imaginable, and Jerry's eyes grew wide with greed. He filled his pockets with as much food as he could, and was about to make his escape when he was spotted by the house cat.

The cat chased Jerry through the house, but the little mouse was quick and clever. He managed to evade the cat and make it back to his hole in the wall, where he feasted on his stolen loot.

But even as he ate, Jerry couldn't shake the feeling that he wanted more. And so, he set his sights on the next big feast, determined to outdo himself and take even more. In the end, his greed was his downfall, as the cat eventually caught him and he could never steal food again.

Story about Vowels,K,Short Story,"There was once a little girl named Ayla who loved the alphabet. She spent every day practicing her letters and trying to write the most beautiful words she could think of. Ayla was especially fond of the vowels - A,E,I,O,U. Because she thought they were the most magical and versatile letters of all.
Ayla decided to embark on an adventure to visit each of the vowels in person one day. She packed a snack bag and set out into the great unknown.
Her first destination was the letter A. Ayla discovered A in the middle of a vast apple orchard, surrounded by rows and rows of juicy, red apples. A was a warm and welcoming letter, and she invited Ayla to stay and pick as many apples as she pleased. Ayla enjoyed eating apples and playing games with A, but it was time for her to move on to her next destination.
Ayla then went to see the letter E. E lived in a grand, elegant seaside mansion. Ayla was in awe of her grand surroundings, and E was the most refined and sophisticated vowel. E showed Ayla around her lovely home and taught her how to waltz. Ayla was having so much fun that she almost didn't want to leave, but she knew she had to continue on her journey.
Ayla's third destination was the letter I. I was living in a bright and colorful circus tent where she was the main attraction. I had a variety of tricks up her sleeve, and she kept Ayla entertained with jumping feats and magical illusions. Ayla was captivated by I's talent and asked if she could stay and learn to perform as well. I was delighted to help, and Ayla spent the rest of the day shaping her skills.
O was the fourth vowel on Ayla's list. O lived in the middle of a dense forest in a large, cozy treehouse. O was the most relaxed and easygoing vowel, and Ayla enjoyed spending time with her and exploring the woods. They made a campfire and sang songs under the stars, and Ayla fell asleep that night completely at ease.
It was finally time for Ayla to meet the final vowel on her list - U. U ruled over a kingdom of mermaids and sea monsters in a beautiful underwater kingdom. U was the most daring and adventurous vowel, and Ayla couldn't wait to see what exciting things she had in store for her. U showed Ayla around her underwater kingdom, pointing out all the wonders of the sea. They rode dolphins, explored fishing boats, and even encountered a giant octopus. Ayla had the time of her life with U and was sad to say goodbye when her journey came to an end.
Ayla knew she'd never forget her incredible adventure with the vowels as she returned home. She'd learned so much and made so many new friends, and she couldn't wait to tell everyone about it.",Story about Vowels.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/PTyYxS-mhaj4lzLuUs2zIA/pJaJ4UupsrRQ8-6cSbZY1NsljsZjNugKFqjDI8az-_92awj3OGz3my1Uq1jLedxNkKFhRCiTFEODFPn1TCT0LmBL2aKDKjLmigb--2BuzMs/iOEu8BjmBi21YD2ndEXJ_yCYERLfwq7X7Q2VCPBIUwU),10

A Story of Twins,K,Short Story,"Once upon a time, there were two identical twin brothers named Max and Mike. They looked exactly the same, but they had very different personalities. Max was kind and generous, always willing to share his things with others. Mike, on the other hand, was greedy and selfish. He always wanted more and never wanted to share.
One day, their parents gave them each a toy. Max was thrilled and immediately gave his toy to his little sister. Mike, however, kept his toy for himself and wouldn't even let his brother play with it.
As they grew older, the twins' differences became even more pronounced. Max would always help his classmates with their work and give them his lunch when they didn't have any. Mike, however, would cheat on tests and steal other kids' lunches.
Despite their different ways, the brothers were still close. Max would often try to teach Mike the importance of sharing and kindness, but Mike just couldn't change his greedy ways.
As they entered adulthood, Max became a successful businessman, known for his fair and generous business practices. Mike, however, struggled to find success as his greediness cost him many opportunities. He ended up working a low paying job and living a lonely life.
In the end, Max learned that money and success were not as important as kindness and generosity. Mike, on the other hand, realized too late the true value of these qualities and the cost of his greed.

The Secret of Happiness,K,Short Story,"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a little boy named Beck. Beck was always looking for the secret of happiness. He asked his parents, his teachers, and even his friends, but nobody could tell him what it was.
One day, while Beck was out playing in the park, he met an old man sitting on a bench. The old man had a kind face and a twinkle in his eye. Beck asked him, ""Do you know the secret of happiness?""
The old man smiled and said, ""Yes, I do. The secret of happiness is to do something kind for someone else.""
Beck was puzzled. ""But how will that make me happy?"" he asked.
The old man replied, ""When you make someone else happy, it brings joy to your own heart. It's like a magic trick! The more you give, the more happiness you will receive.""
Beck thought about this for a moment and then had an idea. He ran back to his house and grabbed a bag of cookies he had baked with his mom. He brought them to the park and shared them with all the children playing there.
As he watched the children enjoy the cookies, Beck felt a warm feeling in his chest. He realized that the old man was right! By making others happy, he had found his own happiness.

The Adventures of Sinbad,K,Short Story,"Sinbad was a young man from Baghdad who possessed his father's wealth. Regrettably, he misspent every penny. So he went to sea to earn money. He joined a trading ship, and the crew landed on a beautiful island on its first voyage. They built a fire and set up camp for the night.
Suddenly, the entire island began to tremble. 'Run!' exclaimed the captain. 'This is not an island, but a massive whale. It's been sleeping for so long that trees have grown on top of it. It will slide down into the depths of the sea.'
In another adventure, he was on a merchant ship that anchored in a desert island bay. A white dome could be seen in the distance, and as they got closer, they realized it was a huge egg.
Sinbad warned the merchants not to touch the egg, but they even broke it and captured the chick. The sky darkened as they placed the chick in their cooking pot. The roc, a huge and terrifying bird, was attacking them in order to save its child.
They all fled back to the ship, but the enraged mother roc gripped a huge big rock in her claws and threw it into the clouds, smashing a hole in their ship. The ship went down like a stone.

The Importance of Eating Healthy,K,Short Story,"Sarah was a young girl who enjoyed nothing more than eating junk food. She would eat chips, candy, and fast food every day with no regard for the consequences.

Sarah's parents sat her down one day and explained the importance of eating healthy to her. They warned her that while junk food may taste good, it is high in empty calories and can lead to serious health problems such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.

Sarah was taken aback by the news and realized she needed to make a change. She started eating more fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins and noticed that she felt more energetic and alert.

Sarah noticed even more positive changes as she continued to eat healthy. She was able to focus better in class, had clearer skin, and even lost weight. She was relieved that she had listened to her parents and chosen to eat healthier.

When Do Hippos Play?,K,Story,"By the African river, know as the Nile
The sun fell away and it rested for a while.

The rhinos had braved all the smoldering heat
They lay down to sleep as they wiped off their feet.

The elephants marched to their elephant beds
And gently they rested their elephant heads.

The hippos went bathing in cool, shallow pools
Thinking the rhinos and elephants fools.

Slowly the hippos sank into the river
The water so cold that it gave them a shiver.

(Hippos can't swim, like the pelicans think
They also can't float, they could easily sink)

Underwater, they fell to the soft river bed
On darkish green plants with a smidgen of red.

They strolled on the bottom, then bounced up for air
They did it for hours, without any care.
 
The fish followed closely, and wove in an out
Under their belly, and up to their snout.

Each of the hippos came up to the shore
To feed on the grass by the river once more.

They dried off their bodies by shaking and stomping
And took bites of grass, chewing and chomping.

With night fading fast, they were full from the feast
The sun returned back, rising up form the east.

The hippos crept off to collapse for the day
While rhinos and elephants got up to play.

Sand was so grateful to Stone for saving him, and Stone was happy to help his friend. They realized that they were stronger together than they were alone, and they were grateful to have each other.
From that day on, Sand and Stone went on many more adventures together, and they always looked out for each other. They were grateful for their friendship and knew that they could always count on each other, no matter what.

The moral of the story is, sometimes we need help from our friends, and it's important to be grateful for their help and support.

The White Rabbits,1,Poem,"White rabbits hopping through the green,
With fluffy tails and ears so keen.
They nibble on the grass so bright,
And dance in the moonlight so right.

With gentle eyes and soft white fur,
They play and frolic, without a care.
They are peaceful creatures, pure and true,
With nature's beauty, in everything they do.

They hop and skip, through the fields so wild,
With joy and grace, they move like a child.
They remind us of the simple things,
And the beauty that life always brings.

To appreciate the world and all its habits,
To live in the moment, and enjoy the peace,

The Kind Tooth Fairy,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom, there lived a tooth fairy named Stella. Stella was a kind and gentle fairy who lived in a beautiful castle made entirely of sugar. She had a special job of collecting children's lost teeth and leaving behind shiny gold coins in exchange.
Every night, Stella would fly out of her castle on her glittery wings to visit children all over the kingdom. She would sneak into their rooms while they were asleep and carefully place the gold coins under their pillows. In return, she would take their lost teeth and add them to her collection.
One night, while on her rounds, Stella came across a young boy named Timmy who had just lost his first tooth. Timmy had been very excited about losing his tooth and leaving it under his pillow for the tooth fairy. However, when Stella arrived at his house, she found that he had accidentally swallowed his tooth while eating dinner.
Stella knew that Timmy would be disappointed if he didn't receive a gold coin, so she flew back to her castle and got to work. She used her magic to turn a piece of candy into a small gold coin and placed it under Timmy's pillow. The next morning, when Timmy woke up and found the gold coin, he was overjoyed. He had never received a coin for a swallowed tooth before.
From that day on, Timmy always made sure to double check his teeth before going to bed, so as not to accidentally swallow them. And Stella continued her work, visiting children all over the kingdom, making sure that each child received a special gift in exchange for their lost teeth.

Rules for Using Punctuation Marks,1,Informative Text,"Punctuation is like the traffic lights for reading. Just like traffic lights tell cars when to stop and go, punctuation tells us when to pause or stop when we're reading sentences. Here are some of the most important punctuation marks and when to use them:
- The period (also called a ""full stop"") is used at the end of a sentence that is not a question or an exclamation. For example: ""I went to the store.""
- The question mark is used at the end of a sentence that is asking a question. For example: ""What did you eat for lunch?""
- 
- The exclamation point is used at the end of a sentence that expresses strong emotion, like excitement or surprise. For example: ""I can't believe we won the game!""
- 
- The comma is used to separate items in a list, and it also shows a natural pause in a sentence. For example: ""I went to the store, but I forgot my list.""
- 
- The apostrophe is used to show possession, like showing that something belongs to someone or something. For example: ""The cat's tail.""
- The quotation marks are used to enclose quoted words. For example: ""He said ""I am so happy"" to his friends""
It's good to practice using punctuation marks when you're writing, and to pay attention to them when you're reading.",Rules for Using Punctuation Marks.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/TIX9wdHOnUsL5ymSx6ZeNw/7cA58Ap8umCWIx4hI2hVIgNtNL5zjxCqrI5B4AEeUgb3lwFh0wNCIAQzLCiBvSjdt0hjAriu1X5tPRASkcm5-uS1N3Zl7uIU2xZ8fuXgxen93wlCi5cph4XgpfGzXzvN/9Q65Db_nYHry66e2kE47D48Z3KmbOZvpeTQuhv-b1Po),116

He cried, “Help! Help! Wolf! Wolf!” Again, the villagers rushed up the hill to help him and again they found that the boy had tricked them. They were very angry with him for being so naughty.

Evolution of Zero,1,Informative Text,"The history of the number zero is lengthy and fascinating. It all started in ancient civilizations, when people used counting systems to keep track of things like how many sheep they owned or how many people were in their tribe.

Initially, these counting systems could only use positive numbers such as 1, 2, 3, and so on. However, as people began to trade with one another and perform more complex mathematics, they realized that they needed a way to represent numbers less than zero.

This is where the zero concept enters the picture. The ancient Greeks and Romans were among the first civilizations to use the concept of zero, but it wasn't until the Indians developed zero as a number in its own right that it really took off.

The number zero was revolutionary because it enabled people to do previously impossible things like subtract numbers from each other. It also allowed for the division of numbers by zero, which led to the development of calculus and many other important mathematical concepts.

Zero is now an essential part of the modern world, with applications ranging from computer programming to finance. Without the concept of zero, many of the things we take for granted today would not be possible.",Evolution of Zero.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/UXnv5kF02wtRK4bhn3zrxg/49j9L89WNcsggyCvGrlOUdlQ7Pn4ndOGTsApC6Iypxxhgr0Gm4YCIty6ZAOvyUq7H0OaiCPkImcWTvxlFJ1G_HMBGBVIV9oh9m2zP940NLs/SPcro7X4STLRPdu1I4TC5NJivr5UmdUQoNu-nn7Cn4c),129

The Wind and the Leaves,1,Poem,"The wind and the leaves go hand in hand,
Dancing together across the land.
Whipping and whirling, spinning and swaying,
The leaves are happy, the wind is playing.

With a rustle and a flutter, they take to the sky,
Up and away, they wave goodbye.
But they'll be back, with a rustle and a flail,
With a gust of wind, they're back on the trail.

The leaves are green and the wind is cold,
Together they're young, together they're old.
The wind whispers secrets, the leaves listen well,
Together they tell stories, together they tell.

So when you hear the wind blowing strong,
And the leaves rustling all day long,
Just remember, they're not alone,
The wind and the leaves are friends, they've grown.

The Mysterious Dog,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, there lived a mysterious dog. No one knew where the dog had come from or how it had ended up in the village. It appeared one day, wandering the streets with a look of confusion on its face.
The villagers were initially afraid of the dog, as it was quite large and had a wild, untamed look about it. But as they began to get to know the dog, they found that it was actually quite friendly and gentle. It seemed to have a special ability to sense when someone was in need of comfort and would often be found sitting next to someone who was feeling sad or lonely.
The villagers named the dog ""Mystery"" and he quickly became a beloved member of the community. Despite his friendly nature, however, Mystery never seemed to fully trust any of the villagers. He would often wander off into the woods for days at a time, returning with no explanation of where he had been or what he had been doing.
One day, a hunter from a neighboring village came to the town, claiming that Mystery was his dog and that he had been missing for months. The villagers were devastated at the thought of losing their beloved Mystery, but the hunter insisted that he had the right to take the dog back with him.
Just as the hunter was about to leave the village with Mystery, a young girl came forward with a surprising revelation. She explained that Mystery had saved her life when she had become lost in the woods. She said that the dog had led her back to the village, but had then vanished into the woods again.
With this new information, the villagers knew that Mystery couldn't possibly be the hunter's missing dog. And so, they rallied around him, refusing to let the hunter take him away. The hunter, seeing the love the villagers had for Mystery, decided to leave the dog in the village, understanding that he had finally found a true home.
Mystery went back to wandering the woods as usual, but he always came back to the village and the people who loved him. And from that day forward, Mystery's past was no longer a mystery - his true home was with the village, and he knew he was where he belonged.",The Mysterious Dog.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/4Xl1oWqniyWMAkXdLwhVAw/GTNzGAFgFrpd48AFknTVYvvOeqP2T-io4CnzVd4betr_KDKwjQtCEDPA_arK2H1gD9SWqHjWlgm1qpdNC4S88Ae_lS2mvQMmhXWlfWfEmNE/TfEtkDaQpmS8TRfrJUDNclDUfI5GK9G9vKdFEECrafA),138

How a Tree and a Traveler Became Friends,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a big and beautiful tree. The tree stood tall and proud in the middle of a vast plain, and its branches stretched high into the sky.
One day, two travelers came upon the tree. They were tired and thirsty from their long journey, and they decided to rest in the shade of the tree's branches.
The first traveler was a kind and generous man, and he took a piece of fruit from the tree and shared it with the second traveler. The second traveler, however, was greedy and selfish. He took all of the fruit that he could find and ate it, leaving none for the first traveler.
The first traveler was disappointed, but he did not say anything. He knew that the tree was big and strong, and that it would grow more fruit for him another day.
The second traveler, on the other hand, was not so wise. He took and took from the tree, without ever giving anything back. Eventually, the tree began to wither and die.
The first traveler saw what was happening and knew that the tree was suffering because of the second traveler's greed. He decided to do something to help the tree. He took care of the tree and watered it, and soon the tree began to grow strong and healthy again.
The second traveler, meanwhile, had nothing left but a barren plain. He realized too late that his greed had cost him everything.

Invisible Alligators,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a group of alligators who had a very unique ability: they were invisible. These invisible alligators lived in a beautiful swamp, hidden from the rest of the world. They were a peaceful and reclusive species, content to live out their days in the murky waters of their home.
The alligators spend most of their days lounging in the sun, soaking up the warmth and enjoying the tranquility of their swamp. They would often swim and play in the water, splashing and laughing as they chased each other around. At night, they would gather around a campfire, listening to stories and songs, passed down through generations.
One day, a group of humans stumbled upon the invisible alligators' swamp. The humans were amazed by the beautiful, secluded place and decided to build a city nearby. The alligators watched in horror as the humans began cutting down trees and building houses and roads. They knew that their peaceful home was in danger.
The alligators held a council to discuss what to do. They knew that they couldn't be seen by the humans, and that if they tried to communicate with them, they would be met with confusion and fear. But they didn't want to leave their home. They decided to use their invisibility to their advantage, and began to quietly sabotage the humans' construction.
At first, the humans couldn't understand what was happening. They would start building a house and it would collapse, or a road would disappear overnight. But as the alligators continued to disrupt the humans' plans, they began to catch on. They realized that there must be something in the swamp that was causing the problems.
In a last-ditch effort, the alligators came out of hiding, revealing their invisibility to the humans in an attempt to make them understand the importance of preserving the swamp and coexisting with the alligators.
To the alligators' surprise, the humans were fascinated by their magical powers and were willing to coexist with the alligators peacefully. They even agreed to help protect the swamp and preserve it for future generations. From then on, the alligators and humans lived in harmony, and the swamp remained a beautiful and peaceful place for all to enjoy.",Invisible Alligators.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/V_rJpFwCgERhBqg76_rWJw/EW3w3qzJD58w1nNIAqufVJMCeokbXxR2NK9ItVzbERmzoYAUdeLOjpb8WdUesuUF8BOScE26Vl1OUxv_dC7f19em64S8OJyZAO0oHUkqrPA/0vLX7N9v7ikoKIA8fT-FqBZk9lOgVedIdlWhx2nyfhg),153

The Lazy Ant,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a lush meadow filled with tall grasses and wildflowers, lived a colony of ants. These ants were hardworking and diligent, spending each day collecting food and tending to the needs of their colony. But among them was one ant who was different from the rest. He was lazy and didn't like to work.
The other ants tried to motivate the lazy ant to join in their work, but he always found an excuse not to. ""I'm too tired,"" he would say. ""I need a break,"" or ""I'll do it later."" But later never came. The lazy ant would spend his days lounging in the sun, while the other ants bustled around him, carrying food and supplies to the colony.
One day, a fierce storm rolled in, bringing with it heavy rain and strong winds. The other ants quickly gathered all the food and supplies they could find and brought them to the safety of the colony, but the lazy ant was nowhere to be found. He had been too busy napping in the sun and hadn't noticed the storm approaching.
As the rain poured down, the lazy ant realized that he was in trouble. He had no food or shelter, and the other ants had closed the entrance to the colony to protect themselves from the storm. The lazy ant was left alone in the meadow, cold and hungry.
Feeling sorry for himself, the lazy ant lay down in the grass and closed his eyes. But as he lay there, he heard a faint rustling sound. He opened his eyes to see a line of ants marching towards him, each one carrying a piece of food or a shelter. The other ants had not forgotten about him and had come to save him.
Feeling ashamed, the lazy ant apologized to the other ants and promised to never be lazy again. From that day forward, he worked hard alongside the other ants, helping to gather food and supplies for the colony. And the colony was once again a happy and thriving community.

The Book Loving Prince,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a young prince named Alexander. Alexander was a curious boy, and from a very young age, he had an insatiable hunger for knowledge. He spent hours upon hours in the palace library, devouring every book he could get his hands on.
As he grew older, his love for books only intensified. He read everything from history books to science fiction, and even delved into ancient texts and manuscripts in search of hidden knowledge. The palace librarian, an old man named Wilhelm, took notice of the young prince's love for books and began to take him under his wing, teaching him how to properly care for the books and how to decipher ancient scripts.
As Alexander became more and more learned, he began to feel a sense of restlessness. He knew that there were so many more books out there waiting to be discovered, and he yearned to explore the wider world to find them. One day, he decided that he could no longer stay cooped up in the palace, and he set out on a journey to seek out new books and new knowledge.

He also built grand libraries, and promoted the importance of education and reading, his kingdom was known as the kingdom of books, where literacy was universal.
Years passed, Alexander himself grew old and passed on, but his legacy lived on, his people continued to read, to learn, and to grow as his kingdom prospered.

The Cunning Fox and the Clever Stork,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a cunning fox named Vixen. He was known for his intelligence and his ability to outsmart other animals.
One day, while wandering through the forest, Vixen came across a clever stork named Arena. She was known for her wisdom and her ability to solve problems with ease.
Vixen, feeling confident in his own abilities, decided to challenge Arena to a test of intelligence.
""I bet I can outsmart you,"" said Vixen with a sly grin.
Arena, being the clever stork that she was, accepted the challenge.
The first test was to see who could reach a bunch of grapes hanging high up in a tree. Vixen tried to jump and climb, but could not reach the grapes. Arena, on the other hand, used her long beak to easily pluck the grapes from the tree.
The second test was to see who could catch a fish from a nearby pond. Vixen tried to catch the fish with his paws, but they were too fast for him. Arena, however, used her beak to catch the fish with ease.
Feeling defeated, Vixen knew that he had met his match in Arena. From that day on, the two animals became good friends and often worked together to solve problems in the forest.

Making of Paper,1,Reading Comprehension,"Paper is a material made from trees. 
It is used for writing, printing, and packaging. 
The process of making paper starts with cutting down trees and turning them into wood chips.

A Friendly Cow,1,Poem,"A friendly cow with spots of brown,
In fields of green she roams around.
Her gentle moo and swishing tail,
Make all the farmers' hearts exhale.

With big, brown eyes and a nose that sniffs,
She chews her cud and leisurely licks,
The grass so green and clover so sweet,
She's a picture of a countryside treat.

She's not just gentle and kind,
But a hard worker, always on her grind,
Giving milk to drink, cheese to make,
With her help, the farm won't shake.

Though often underestimated,
This friendly cow should be celebrated,
For she's a part of nature's tapestry,
And the true beauty of the country.

What Is Pink?,1,Poem,"Pink is a color so bright,
Like a rose in the morning light.
It's the hue of a newborn's cheek,
So soft and so sweet, so unique.

It's the shade of a strawberry so plump,
Juicy and delicious, it'll make your mouth jump.

Drifting and floating, it's quite profound.
It's the tint of a sunset in the sky,
So beautiful and peaceful, it's no lie.

And gives a rainbow its sass.

We skip and we play,
And chase the clouds away.

And turns the world to gold and cheers,

One day, while the ant was carrying a piece of bread back to her colony, she slipped and fell into a stream. She tried to climb out, but the stream was too deep and the current too strong. Just as she was about to give up, a dove saw her struggling and flew down to help.
The dove said, ""Don't worry, little ant. I'll help you out of the stream."" And with that, the dove picked up the ant in her beak and flew her to safety on the bank.
The ant was very grateful to the dove and said, ""Thank you for saving me. I will always remember your kindness.""
A few weeks later, the ant was out foraging for food when she saw a hunter with a net. The hunter was after the dove, who had nested in a tree nearby. The ant quickly ran back to her colony and told the other ants what she had seen.
The ants rallied together and formed a plan to save the dove. They climbed up the tree and gnawed through the net, freeing the dove just in the nick of time.
The dove was so touched by the ant's bravery and the efforts of her colony. She said, ""Thank you, little ants. I will always remember your kindness.""

Tweety's Cherry Tree,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there lived a little bird named Tweety. Tweety was small, with bright yellow feathers and a cheerful chirp. She lived in a cozy nest high up in a tall tree, near the top of the forest canopy.
Every day, Tweety would wake up early and stretch her wings. She would then set out to explore the forest and find her breakfast. She would flit from branch to branch, singing her little song as she went. The other birds in the forest were always delighted to see her, and they would chirp and sing along with her as she passed by.
One day, as Tweety was flying through the forest, she came across a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a beautiful cherry tree. The cherries were ripe and plump, and Tweety couldn't resist the temptation to try one. She flew down and plucked a cherry from the tree. It was the sweetest thing she had ever tasted!
From that day on, Tweety made it her daily routine to fly to the clearing and eat cherries from the tree. She would always save one cherry for her friend, the robin who lived in the forest. Together they would enjoy the sweet taste of cherries, and sing songs to the cherries tree.
Years went by and Tweety grew old, but she never forgot the cherry tree and the happy memories she shared with her friend, the robin. Even in her old age, she would still fly to the clearing and sit in the cherry tree, surrounded by the sweet smell of ripe cherries, and sing her little song to the birds who still lived in the forest.
One day, Tweety didn't fly back to her nest and she was found under the cherry tree, she had passed away peacefully, with a cherry in her beak.The birds in the forest all came to pay their respects to Tweety, and to remember the joy and happiness she had brought to their lives. The cherry tree was forever known as Tweety's cherry tree, and it was a place of happiness, friendship and cherries.",Tweety's Cherry Tree.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/LGWAqVqUjVmc985BmP5Zfg/F-f0V1wToyOI2C_BlGvjc5Nl5kxx7kEP8ZbF_hfOHPFpKWOM5A4hh8V-soMIbzneD5UdTjpMiGHKZSWU2ke-kDhaIro5x1R894wqnhBvxDc/RXB-1H5Vk4HsXJlb4uywslD5hjOyiJlFg6Tx27S-iaU),182
Bed in Summer,1,Poem,"In winter I get up at night
And dress by yellow candle-light.
In summer, quite the other way,
I have to go to bed by day.
I have to go to bed and see
The birds still hopping on the tree,
Or hear the grown-up people’s feet
Still going past me in the street.

The Rabbit's Bride,1,Short Story ,"There was once a woman who lived with her daughter in a beautiful cabbage-garden; and there came a rabbit and ate up all the cabbages. At last the woman said to her daughter, ""Go into the garden, and drive out the rabbit.""
""Shoo! shoo!"" said the maiden; ""don't eat up all our cabbages, little rabbit!"" ""Come, maiden,"" said the rabbit, ""sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch."" But the maiden would not.
Another day, back came the rabbit, and ate away at the cabbages, until the woman said to her daughter, ""Go into the garden, and drive away the rabbit."" ""Shoo! shoo!"" said the maiden; ""don't eat up all our cabbages, little rabbit!"" ""Come, maiden,"" said the rabbit, ""sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch."" But the maiden would not.
Again, a third time back came the rabbit, and ate away at the cabbages, until the woman said to her daughter, ""Go into the garden, and drive away the rabbit."" ""Shoo! shoo!"" said the maiden; ""don't eat up all our cabbages, little rabbit!"" ""Come, maiden,"" said the rabbit, ""sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch."" And then the girl seated herself on the rabbit's tail, and the rabbit took her to his hutch.
""Now,"" said he, ""set to work and cook some bran and cabbage; I am going to bid the wedding guests."" And soon they were all collected. Would you like to know who they were? Well, I can only tell you what was told to me; all the hares came, and the crow who was to be the parson to marry them, and the fox for the clerk, and the altar was under the rainbow. But the maiden was sad, because she was so lonely.
""Get up! get up!"" said the rabbit, ""the wedding folk are all merry."" But the bride wept and said nothing, and the rabbit went away, but very soon came back again.
""Get up! get up!"" said he, ""the wedding folk are waiting."" But the bride said nothing, and the rabbit went away. Then she made a figure of straw, and dressed it in her own clothes, gave it a red mouth, and set it to watch the kettle of bran, and then she went home to her mother. Back again came the rabbit, saying, ""Get up! get up!"" and he went up and hit the straw figure on the head, so that it tumbled down.
And the rabbit thought that he had killed his bride, and he went away and was very sad.",The Rabbit's Bride.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/RuOwIfhGBjKkp8E9uJDk8A/Oqd6YiLjOwV4F7vMaDDcz0r3SFzOjWSUSs-v_4Rnauvh_Hy_GN_-du1klG4dK-MGciRksnF7waxDVm6j881p7kXWWZ7_z103lhHAEf7vWWI/sjQ0wpwoUe_FWcx080FpC99GQBLEAVY9NDnyWm1Rj10),184
"The Lion, Jupiter and the Elephant",1,Short Story ,"The lion wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints. 
“It is true, O Jupiter!” he said, “that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in shape, and powerful in attack. I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet furnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest, and what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be frightened by the crowing of a cock.”
Jupiter replied, “Why do you blame me without a cause? I have given you all the attributes which I possess myself, and your courage never fails you except in this one instance.” 
On hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and, reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die. 
As these thoughts passed through his mind, he met an Elephant and came close to hold a conversation with him. After a time he observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor every now and then. 
Just at that moment a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied, “Do you see that little buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed. I should die now.” 
The Lion said, “Well, since such a huge beast is afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself dead. I find myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant.”","""The Lion, Jupiter and the Elephant.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/i0pS02cLMYSZ2mkexyCrww/JkrVyVjWra15_XmxLHH4WVITExx5aZTWd4ZPvylWmySV2UfGnBsMgb7TI1O3PtViq1pizyWT-FPGGH6mf4--ZaPVZf4xCelU-c0K3XjzuPvbcGCVU89J83YogFrqCL9E/FHPIDjiL9_gylYx20_nWqo4wzobhjaoSJKMfgkRea08)""",185
The Fieldmouse,1,Poem,"Where the acorn tumbles down,
Where the ash tree sheds its berry,
With your fur so soft and brown,
With your eye so round and merry,
Scarcely moving the long grass,
Fieldmouse, I can see you pass.

Little thing, in what dark den,
Lie you all the winter sleeping?
Till warm weather comes again,
Then once more I see you peeping
Roundabout the tall tree roots,
Nibbling at their fallen fruits.

Fieldmouse, fieldmouse, do not go,
Where the farmer stacks his treasure,
Find the nut that falls below,
Eat the acorn at your pleasure,
But you must not steal the grain
He has stacked with so much pain.

Make your hole where mosses spring,
Underneath the tall oak's shadow,
Pretty, quiet harmless thing,
Play about the sunny meadow.
Keep away from corn and house,
None will harm you, little mouse.",The Fieldmouse.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/bNb96XGMdPUtCbH75_u76Q/h_eTIerygw8VGTiFIlhF7kARniN4qnYKM6kWc-Ja5pojT1uIqnwS_N9zQsmrIi8HrNKJkb0ewBj_-A2v4mLgmgH5ZkHTr0AEO3eTiugamh4/ILvlLc2m96RqAjWLmX-QuomjgS12EosedluFKMgAVpw),186
A Cursed Prince,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a powerful and wise king who ruled over the land with fairness and justice. However, the king had one great sorrow, for he had no children to inherit his throne and continue his good work.

One day, a strange old man came to the palace, claiming that he had a potion that could grant the king a child. The king was skeptical, but desperate for an heir, so he agreed to try the potion. The old man brewed the king with a curse that could only be broken if the king's firstborn child was brought back to the palace by a talking frog.

Years passed and the king's wife finally gave birth to a baby boy, but the curse struck and the baby was kidnapped by an evil witch. The king was beside himself with grief, and he made a public announcement that whoever could bring back his son would be richly rewarded.

An ordinary frog heard the king's announcement and decided to take up the challenge. He set out on a journey to rescue the prince, facing many obstacles along the way. The frog had to outsmart a giant, escape from a dragon, and outwit a clever fox, but he never gave up.

Eventually, the frog found the witch's castle, where the prince was being held, and there he had to use all his wit and cunning to outsmart the witch and rescue the prince. The frog successfully rescued the prince and brought him back to the palace, thus breaking the curse and restoring the king's happiness.

The king was overjoyed and kept his promise to the frog, rewarding him with riches and honors. The frog, however, refused them all, asking only to be granted one small favor: to be made a prince himself and to live in the palace forever, by the side of the king and the prince. The king, touched by the frog's selflessness, granted his request, and so the frog became the prince's loyal companion and friend.",A Cursed Prince.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/F_is2gkirbKIZpeownO51g/5qnHif5srNAGrIAQHSzs2vuChjn07yJls_YLMlP5k1x725JaGPUwN6faVrcje7hqXRzwnLIEMptrL91YNNhLqlVNZj6nu1tXLhdKSDTAUkQ/mHeO0zvj0TAvu5LaCnoIAx5gP_KdllXihvMwf1YsFlQ),187

They soon reached the island and the monkey came down from the dolphin’s back. The dolphin asked the monkey, “Do you know this place?”
The monkey replied, “Yes, I do. In fact, the king of the island is my best friend. Do you know that I am actually a prince?”
Knowing that no one lived on the island, the dolphin said, “Well, well, so you are a prince! Now you can be a king!” The monkey asked, “How can I be a king?”

Rising up to heavens door,
With innocent hearts full of grace,
They ask for a friend to share their space.

For every child needs someone true,
A companion, to laugh and coo,
A playmate for dolls and games,
With whom to share their childhood flames.

So they kneel and fold their hands,
And send their wish to distant lands,
For a brother or sister to share,
In the joys and sorrows of life's care.

And as they dream of someone new,
The angels listen and hear their plea,
For a child's prayer is a special thing,
It brings love and happiness on wings.

The Hungry Fox,1,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, there was a hungry fox that was looking for something to eat. He was very hungry. No matter how hard he tried, the fox could not find food. Finally he went to the edge of the forest and searched there for food. Suddenly he caught sight of a big tree with a hole in it.
Inside the hole was a package. The hungry fox immediately thought that there might be food in it, and became very happy. He jumped into the hole. When he opened the package, he saw slices of bread, meat and fruit in it!
An old woodcutter had placed the food in the tree trunk before he began to cut down trees in the forest. He was going to eat it for his lunch.
The fox happily began to eat. After he finished eating, he felt thirsty and decided to leave the hole and drink some water from a nearby spring.

The Dog and the Cook,2,Short Story ,"A rich man gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends and acquaintances. 
His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, “My master gives a feast, and there is always much food remaining; come and sup with me tonight.” 
The Dog thus invited went at the hour appointed, and seeing the preparations for so grand an entertainment, said in the joy of his heart, “How glad I am that I came! I do not often get such a chance as this. I will take care and eat enough to last me both today and tomorrow.” 
While he was congratulating himself and wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to his friend, the Cook saw him moving about among his dishes and, seizing him by his fore and hind paws, bundled him without ceremony out of the window. 
He fell with force upon the ground and limped away, howling dreadfully. His yelling soon attracted other street dogs, who came up to him and inquired how he had enjoyed his supper.

The Tale of a Foolish King,2,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, there was a foolish king who ruled over a prosperous kingdom. He was known for his vanity and lack of wisdom, and often made foolish decisions that put his people in danger.
One day, a wise old man came to the king and warned him that a great disaster was about to befall the kingdom if he did not change his ways. But the king, blinded by his pride, refused to listen and chased the old man away.
Sure enough, the disaster came in the form of a powerful enemy army that invaded the kingdom and laid waste to its cities and towns. The king, realizing too late the wisdom of the old man's words, begged for forgiveness and promised to change his ways.
But it was too late, and the kingdom was lost.

Emily lived in a small village in rural England, where she spent her days exploring the countryside and helping her family on their farm. Sophia lived in a bustling city in Brazil, where she loved to dance and play soccer with her friends.
Despite their different lifestyles, Emily and Sophia had a lot in common. They both loved reading and writing, and they both had a passion for learning about different cultures.
They first met through a pen pal program at their schools. They were paired together by chance and began writing to each other regularly. As they got to know each other better, their friendship grew stronger. They shared their hopes and dreams, their struggles and successes, and their love for their families and communities.
Years went by, and the girls grew up. They both went to university, but they never lost touch. They continued to write to each other, and their friendship only grew stronger with time.
Eventually, they decided to meet in person. Emily saved up her money and took a trip to Brazil to visit Sophia. They were finally able to see each other face to face after years of writing. It was a dream come true for both of them. They spent a wonderful week together, exploring the city, dancing, and catching up on all the things they had missed in each other's lives.

The Great Hill,2,Short Story ,"Before time was time, there was a Great Hill.  And on the Great Hill there lived the Yolks. The Yolks spent their entire lives climbing the Great Hill, trying to reach the top. Some Yolks climbed fast. Some Yolks climbed slowly.
One Yolk in particular was a very slow climber. He was different from the rest of the Yolks. When he climbed, all the other Yolks passed him.  It was hard for him to watch them pass by. He felt like the worst climber in the world.
Some Yolks made fun of him as they passed. Others didn’t. Some Yolks wanted to help him climb but he didn’t let them. It was hard for him to climb. It was even harder when it rained because the ground got slippery. Sometimes it seemed like it was only raining on him.  But it wasn’t.
There were times when he felt like he wasn’t moving at all.  But he was. Then one day he met another Yolk who climbed even slower than he did. He helped the slower Yolk climb.
“Thank You,” said the slower Yolk. “You’re Welcome,” said the slow Yolk, “I can’t be of much help to anyone else since I climb so slowly.” “Slowly?” asked the slower Yolk. “Well yes. I watch other Yolks pass me all the time.”  “I do not know if you are slow or fast, but I do know that you helped me, and that you are still climbing.”
The slow Yolk said goodbye to the slower Yolk, and kept climbing.  “Still climbing,” he thought to himself.  “That is true.”  And he smiled. So the Yolk kept climbing. He climbed when it was nice out, he climbed when it rained, and he even climbed when it snowed.
As he kept climbing he got better and better.  Sometimes he would pass other Yolks and sometimes they would pass him.  He had stopped paying attention.  He also noticed that some Yolks were no longer climbing.  When a yolk stops climbing it stays where it is. 
Some Yolks stop climbing because they are happy with how far they have gone.  Others stop climbing because they don’t want to climb anymore.  The Yolks that had stopped climbing did not like to be passed, and they made it harder to get by.  But the Yolk kept climbing, right over them!
There were still times when the Yolk thought he was climbing an impossible hill, but he kept climbing.  Always, always, climbing.

The Snowman Problem,2,Reading Comprehension,"It was a cold winter day and two friends, John and Sarah, decided to build a snowman together. They gathered all the necessary supplies, such as a carrot for the nose and buttons for the eyes, and headed outside to find the perfect spot in the snow.
As they began to roll the first snowball for the snowman's body, they encountered their first problem. The snow was too dry and wouldn't stick together, making it difficult to form a large snowball. After several attempts, they finally managed to create a snowball large enough for the body.
Next, they moved on to the head of the snowman, but encountered another problem. The snow was so fluffy and light that it wouldn't stay on top of the body. John and Sarah tried using sticks and twigs to hold the head in place, but it kept falling off.
After several unsuccessful attempts, they decided to take a break and warm up with some hot cocoa. While they were sitting and chatting, John had an idea. They could use the extra buttons and sticks to create a sort of scaffolding to hold the head in place.
With this new approach, they were able to successfully construct the head and add all the finishing touches to the snowman.

The daisies have shut up their sleepy red eyes,
And the birds and the bees are at rest.

Lady-bird, Lady-bird, fly away home,
The glow worm is lighting her lamp,
The dew’s falling fast, and your fine speckled wings,
Will flag with the close clinging damp.

The fairy bells tinkle afar,
Make haste or they’ll catch you and harness you fast,
With a cobweb to Oberon’s star.",Ladybird Ladybird.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/C-ThNs26H733-Kaf6Cm6LA/B11eaehOVgj1nZj1egBZp9RO_1_Njil3fmi3G20uSc42v_kU7Ul_5mI5ftTe1y5VsVJCYQ7b3VbIIaeHOu5gvRKtDaaoMvrhrKndMJUQgx0/9GwZcUhU7pgbJnzKm0-Vp3JG5yTPwlq8s9T8f6j56ng),217
The Story of Cinderella ,2,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there lived a young woman named Cindy. She lived with her cruel stepmother and stepsisters, who made her do all the household chores and treated her like a servant. Cindy was a kind and hardworking person, but she felt lonely and unappreciated.
One day, the city held a ball to celebrate the prince's birthday. Cindy's stepmother and stepsisters were invited, but they forbid Cindy from going. Heartbroken, Cindy retreated to the garden to cry. Suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared before her. She was an older woman who was a successful businesswoman and had always taken pity on Cindy's situation.
The fairy godmother said, ""Cindy, I know your life has been difficult, but I have a surprise for you. I am going to turn you into a modern Cinderella and you will attend the ball."" With a wave of her wand, Cindy's ragged clothes turned into a beautiful modern dress, and her old sneakers turned into sparkly heels.
Cindy was amazed and thanked her fairy godmother. She then made her way to the ball, where she caught the prince's eye immediately. They danced the night away, and the prince was smitten with Cindy's kindness and beauty. However, as the clock struck twelve, Cindy had to leave, forgetting to leave her glass slipper behind.
The prince searched the entire city for the owner of the glass slipper. When he finally arrived at Cindy's house, her stepmother and stepsisters tried to claim the slipper, but it was a perfect fit for Cindy. The prince knew she was the one he had been looking for and they lived happily ever after.
Cindy's fairy godmother was right, life was hard but she had the strength to overcome it. With the prince's love and support, she was able to start her own business and helped her stepmother and stepsisters to change their ways, they all lived together in peace and happiness.
The prince and Cindy's love story had spread throughout the city and they were known as the modern Cinderella and Prince Charming. They were a reminder that love can come in unexpected ways and that, with determination and a kind heart, anyone can overcome their circumstances and live happily ever after.",The Story of Cinderella .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/3Nj3Ts6g-lK34LKLkdrNNA/lWRr1iCTSKvQrgkotIvLPs1mIsy1w5D85H1R7_zcjxyOrz4DccNTPTbsCEEZB9wtPFBBLZfKmLtlO9fuQUvnMiWNNAj5fWy0dQMm2HUh8ro/i3OySeOFVIjeZ8t1uGp95ZXur6Cu4RpSNyrqEnBIfBg),218

The Beautiful World,2,Poem,"The world is a beautiful place,
With its mountains and its seas,
Its forests and its deserts,
Its cities and its countryside.

There's beauty in the changing seasons,
In the springtime's newborn green,
In the summer's golden sunshine,
In the fall's golden leaves,
In the winter's snowy gleam.

There's beauty in the creatures,
Big and small, that roam the earth,
In the birds that take to flight,
In the animals that roam the land,
In the fishes that swim in the sea.

There's beauty in the people,
In their diverse cultures and traditions,
In the way they love and laugh and live.

And all the wonders it holds,
And do our part to keep it bright,
For generations yet to come. ",The Beautiful World.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/6OmgoJePS-RN0hkMkl1ozA/kEpAINQkcwyjlvp2Dn9qvDWx4uXUJTb77cuxTl4ECOdeS1UKz0XBPGn0RsKrfWpC_HO7F5Q0ATmqOi0Zt6FVVAR1sJGCfbN5oH6qhSOs_DE/dF2EhcF22hBGQrY40VITflBLxNrEq6D-CEUJoUb4bPo),220
Come Lasses and Lads,2,Short Story ,"Come Lasses and Lads, get leave of your Dads,
Get leave of your Dads
And away to the May-pole hey:

For every he
Has got him a she,
with a minstrel standing by.

For Willy has gotten his Jill,
And Johnny has got his Jone,
To jigg it, jigg it, jigg it, jigg it,
Jigg it up and down.

""Strike up,"" says Watt; ""Agreed,"" says Kate,
""And I prithee, Fiddler, play;""
""Content,"" says Hodge, and so says Madge,
For this is a Holiday!
Then every man did put his hat off to his lass,
And every girl did curchy, curchy, curchy on the grass.

""Begin,"" says Hall; ""Ay, ay,"" says Mall,
""We'll lead up Packington's pound:""
""No, no,"" says Noll, and so says Doll,
""We'll first have Sellenger's round.""

Then every man began to foot it round about,
And every girl did jet it,
Jet it, jet it in and out.

""You're out,"" says Dick; ""Not I,"" says Nick.
""The Fiddler played it false;""
""'Tis true,"" says Hugh, and so says Sue,
And so says nimble Alice.

The Fiddler then began to play the tune again,
And every girl did trip it,
Trip it, trip it to the men.

Then after an hour, they went to a bower,
And played for ale and cakes,
And kisses too—until they were due the lasses held the stakes.

The girls did then begin to quarrel with the men,
And bid them take their kisses back, and give them their own again,
And bid them take their kisses back and give them their own again.

Now there they did stay the whole of the day,
And tired the Fiddler quite,
With singing and playing, without any paying,
From morning until night.

Singing and playing
From morning til night
They told the Fiddler then, they'd pay him for his play,
And each a 2-pence, 2-pence, 2-pence, gave him and went away.

Rain,2,Informative Text,"Rain is a vital component of the Earth's water cycle and plays a crucial role in the health of ecosystems and the growth of plants. Rain is a form of precipitation that falls to the Earth's surface as water droplets. It is formed when the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor, which condenses into droplets that fall to the ground. The amount of rain that falls in a particular area is measured in inches or millimeters, and is often described as light, moderate, or heavy.
Rain is caused by various weather systems, such as thunderstorms, tropical storms, and fronts. Thunderstorms are formed when warm, moist air rises and cools, forming clouds. As the clouds continue to rise, the water droplets inside them begin to grow and fall as rain. Tropical storms, on the other hand, are formed over warm ocean waters and are characterized by strong winds and heavy rain. Fronts, which are boundaries between different air masses, can also cause rain. When a warm front moves into an area, it can bring rain as the warm air rises and cools, forming clouds and precipitation.
Rain is an important part of the Earth's water cycle, as it replenishes surface water sources such as lakes, rivers, and aquifers. It also helps to maintain the balance of water in the environment, by recharging groundwater and providing water for plants and animals. Rainwater harvesting is also an important technique to conserve water in areas with low rainfall.
Rain also plays a crucial role in the growth of plants. It provides the water plants need to survive and grow, and it also helps to dissolve nutrients in the soil, making them available for plants to absorb. Additionally, rain can also help to control the temperature of the Earth's surface. By evaporating, rain cools the air, which can be especially important in hot, dry areas.
However, excessive rain can also cause problems. Heavy rain can lead to flooding, landslides, and erosion. It can also damage infrastructure and crops, and can make roads and bridges impassable. Additionally, the acid rain which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels, causing the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere can cause damage to plants, animals, and buildings.
In conclusion, rain is an essential component of the Earth's water cycle and plays a vital role in the health of ecosystems and the growth of plants. It replenishes surface water sources and helps to maintain the balance of water in the environment. However, excessive rain can also cause problems and it's important to be aware of the potential hazards and take necessary precautions.",Rain.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/47FOlRQQ662CD9_jgMz7UA/2sn36k8sQndgvorH6Cw-R11DjCk05_uzHwLyXIFHpSQWE4GWOCYFL2NGFe6fYAlKIyfUqqxMuHcjImOvP5oyKg/G5P6Q7MkINqWCsICOykW5b-5AWJLbSeuEZHFbvuVJF8),222

The Violets,2,Short Story ,"The sun came out and shone down on the leafless trees that cast hardly any shadows on the pathway through the woods.
""Surely the Spring is coming,"" the birds said; ""it must be time to wake the flowers.""
The thrush, and the lark, and the linnet sang sweetly. A robin flew up from the snow, and perched upon a branch; a little ragged boy at the end of the wood stopped and listened.
""Surely the Spring is coming,"" he too said; ""and mother will get well.""
The flowers that all through the Winter had been sleeping in the ground heard the birds, but they were drowsy, and longed to sleep on. At last the snowdrops came up and looked shiveringly about; and a primrose leaf peeped through the ground, and died of cold. 
Then some violets opened their blue eyes, and, hidden beneath the tangle of the wood, listened to the twittering of the birds. The little ragged boy came by; he saw the tender flowers, and, stooping down, gathered them one by one, and put them into a wicker basket that hung upon his arm.
""Dear flowers,"" he said, with a sigh, as if loth to pick them, ""you will buy poor mother some breakfast,"" and, tying them up into little bunches, he carried them to the town. All the morning he stood by the road-side, offering his flowers to the passers-by, but no one took any notice of him; and his face grew sad and troubled. ""Poor mother!"" he said, longingly; and the flowers heard him, and sighed.
""Those violets are very sweet,"" a lady said as she passed; the boy ran after her.
""Only a penny,"" he said, ""just one penny, for mother is at home."" Then the lady bought them, and carried them to the beautiful house in which she lived, and gave them some water, touching them so softly that the poor violets forgot to long for the woods, and looked gratefully up into her face.
""Mother,"" said the boy, ""see, I have brought some bread for your breakfast. The violets sent it to you,"" and he put the little loaf down before her.
The birds knew nothing of all this, and went on singing till the ground was covered with flowers, till the leaves had hidden the brown branches of the trees, and the pathway through the woods was all shade, save for the sunshine that flecked it with light.",The Violets.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/aWkBW6MpcneieC468QHanw/J8VaJA_-O18MBS7RBCOYD59II6aIYsM8KPjV0BzSzO239HM9vmz14zt9Jfxr-SHDp5kdWJ2RUgx9JOylkmUWVkigxQ6giiDZj0gmETjOdio/WlTWP3sI89xC2ty9_B-DXMUwqhzqbnhti_0c6zyUc8s),224
Winning Is Not Everything ,2,Reading Comprehension,"It is important to understand that winning is not the only thing that matters in life. There are many other things that are important, such as being happy, healthy, and having good relationships with the people around you. When you focus too much on winning, you can lose sight of these other important things.

Another thing to consider is that winning is not always within your control. Sometimes, even if you do your best, you may not win. It is important to understand that this is okay and that it is not the end of the world. It is important to learn from your experiences and to keep moving forward.

Finally, it is important to understand that winning is not the only measure of success. Success is different for everyone, and it is important to define success for yourself. For some people, success may mean winning a big competition, while for others it may mean having a happy family or a fulfilling career.

The Boy and Little Great Lady,2,Short Story ,"She was always called the ""little great lady,"" for she lived in a grand house, and was very rich. He was a strange boy; the little great lady never knew whence he came, or whither he went. She only saw him when the snow lay deep upon the ground. Then in the early morning he swept a pathway to the stable in which she had once kept a white rabbit. 
When it was quite finished, she came down the steps in her white dress and little thin shoes, with bows on them, and walked slowly along the pathway. It was always swept so dry she might have worn paper shoes without getting them wet. 
At the far end he always stood waiting till she came, and smiled and said, ""Thank you, little boy,"" and passed on. Then he was no more seen till the next snowy morning, when again he swept the pathway; and again the little great lady came down the steps in her dainty shoes, and went on her way to the stable.
But at last, one morning when the snow lay white and thick, and she came down the steps as usual, there was no pathway. The little boy stood leaning on a spade, his feet buried deep in the snow.
""Where is your broom? and where is the pathway to the rabbit house?"" she asked.
""The rabbit is dead, and the broom is worn out,"" he answered; ""and I am tired of making pathways that lead to empty houses.""
""But why have you done it so long?"" she asked.
""You have bows on your shoes,"" he said; ""and they are so thin you could not walk over the snow in them—why, you would catch your death of cold,"" he added, scornfully.
""What would you do if I wore boots?""
""I should go and learn how to build ships, or paint pictures, or write books. But I should not think of you so much,"" he said.
The little great lady answered eagerly, ""Go and learn how to do all those things; I will wait till you come back and tell me what you have done,"" and she turned and went into the house.
""Good-bye,"" the boy said, as he stood watching for a moment the closed door; ""dear little great lady, good-bye.""

The Rainbow Maker,2,Short Story ,"The children stood under an archway. Behind them was the blue sky; in front of them the clear, still lake that wandered and wound about the garden; above their heads the leaves of a tree whispered and told strange stories to the breeze.
""Poor tree! it is sighing for the blossoms the wind has carried away,"" they said to each other, and they looked back at the garden. ""And, poor flowers, too,"" they said, ""all your bright colors are gone, and your petals lie scattered on the ground; to-morrow they will be dead."" 
""Ah, no,"" the flowers sighed, ""the rainbow-maker will gather them up, and once more they will see the sun."" Before the children could answer, a tall fair maiden came down the pathway. They could see her plainly in the twilight. Her eyes were dim with gathering tears, but on her lips there was a smile that came and went and flickered round her mouth. 
All down her back hung her pale golden hair; round her neck was a kerchief of many colors; her dress was soft and white, and her snowy apron was gathered up in one hand. She looked neither to the right nor to the left. She did not utter a single word; and the children could hear no sound of her footsteps, no rustling from her dress. 
She stooped, and picking up the fading petals, looked at them tenderly for a moment, while the tears fell slowly down her cheeks; but the smile hovered around her mouth; for she knew that they would shine again in the sight of their beloved sun. 
When her apron was quite full, she turned round and left the garden. Hand-in-hand the children followed. She went slowly by the side of the lake, far, far away across the meadows and up the farthest hill, until at last she found her home behind a cloud just opposite the sun. 
There she sat all through the summer days making rainbows. When the children had watched her for a long long time, they went softly back to their own home. The rainbow-maker had not even seen them.
""Mother,"" they said one day, ""we now know where the colors go from the flowers. See, they are there,"" and as they spoke they thought of the maiden sitting silently at work in her cloud-home. They knew that she was weeping at sending forth her most beautiful one, and yet smiling as she watched the soft archway she had made. 
""See, they are all there, dear mother,"" the children repeated, looking at the falling rain and the shining sun, and pointing to the rainbow that spanned the river.",The Rainbow Maker.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/8XKpoH5XQ-xHjvuiE_vFnw/w2fDMRqsHl0IA-tZSyohBgMD_5vyK1cykyreMK_rBCSb9qa6wlmrkcWcLr5NRCnqONNHkf8UbR8PurgFetH9cGLydqtraKSZ5a8ei4pe_OM/IQX3xPLT8tIfM1kzigKh7jwslhXPcRnZXhqcHlMxutc),232

The Owl,2,Poem,"Silent wings in the night
Mystery in its flight
Eyes that gleam in the dark
The owl, a master of the park.

Perched on branch so still and wise
Watching over its forest prize
Hooting softly in the breeze
Nature's secrets it will not release.

With its keen eyes and stealthy tread
It hunts its prey without a shred
Of fear or hesitation
A true night's domination.

Oh owl, wise and wild and free
Your beauty and grace, a sight to see
In the darkness, you come alive
And soar on wings that truly thrive.",The Owl.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/qb9ow0oVEtolZyMxhNnbTg/n9P_e_e6QropVUydVBVhVGuxnUcvvX9e08APvHC8B93waF8bQ8fSPAybZ0TCVOfBxROpzbr4S_QM-if8pNcGHI20lWKr2z7YkmJkyUuFl80/w2LR3Uxe884jfBOqlQdjIkopa3ycWw1otavyDhs1hLw),234

Ruby and Her Cat,2,Short Story ,"One day Ruby's kitten runs out of the house and climbs up a tree.
The kitten is afraid to come down. Ruby tries everything. She makes purring sounds and puts out warm milk and the kitten's favorite toy. Nothing works.
The tree is much too weak to climb, but Ruby has an idea. She ties a rope to the tree branch. She pulls on the rope very slowly to make the branch bend down low enough for her to grab the kitten.
Ruby pulls just a little bit at a time. Suddenly, the rope breaks. The tree goes ""Boing!"" and the cat goes flying through the air, out of sight.
Ruby feels terrible. She looks and looks, but can't find the cat anywhere.
The next day, Ruby sees her neighbor Sam in the supermarket. Sam does not like cats, but has a cart full of cat food.
""You hate cats. Why are you buying cat food?"" asks Ruby. Sam answers, ""You'll never believe this. My daughter has been asking for a cat for a long time. I always told her that a cat would have to fall from the sky, because I wasn't going to get one!""

A Chicken So Small,2,Poem,"There once was a chicken so small,
He was no bigger than a basketball.
He couldn't lay eggs, he couldn't cluck,
But boy, could he fit in a truck!

He went to the store, in his tiny little shoe,
And bought himself a tiny little chew.
He ate it up fast, and then said with glee,
""Now I can lay the tiniest egg you'll ever see!""

But when he tried to lay it, oh what a shock,
The egg got stuck, and he began to rock.
He wiggled and wiggled, and shook his behind,
But the egg wouldn't budge, it was stuck in his mind.

So he went to the vet, to get some advice,
The vet took one look, and began to slice.
He cut the egg loose, with a tiny little knife,
And the chicken was free, without any strife.

So if you ever see a chicken so small,
Just remember, he may be no bigger than a basketball,
But he can lay eggs, and he can cluck,
And he'll never get stuck, like that silly little duck!",A Chicken So Small.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/UQryeobz2TC-v2v0yzlj7w/ql4r_tbsBinudA-hqPnQfm90gjchpMh7u01YfzUQIS-8wpuC-zF4rfjWpF6sR02oDH56eL4A8w4YX5PnZejRk1ACfPbo8B8QYvrvhKkpBRI/OM_CNq_RQCifra42XeXViTFHGNiAhZKWurTHPYCBPW4),238
The Children and the Garland,2,Short Story,"""To-morrow is May-day,"" the children said; ""the birds must call us very early, and we will go to the woods and make a garland."" And in the morning, long before the sun had looked over the tops of the houses into the village street, they were far away in the woods.
""I will give them some roses as they come back,"" the gardener said. ""They shall put them among the spring flowers, as a swallow among the thrushes, to show that summer is on its way.""
When the children had made their garland and a posy for each one of them, they went singing all down the village street, over the grey stone bridge, beyond the hayricks, and past the houses on the hill-side.
In one of the houses there was a pale little child with a sad, thin face. ""Mother,"" he said, ""here are some children with a garland. Will it be summer when they have gone by?"" He called after them as they went on, ""Come back, oh, come back again!""
""Yes, we will come back,"" they answered, but they went on their way singing. All through the day he waited for them, but they did not come; and at last, when it was evening, the mother took[Pg 63] him up into her arms to carry him to his bed. Suddenly he heard the children singing in the distance. ""Oh, mother,"" he exclaimed, ""they are coming;"" and he watched till they came up the hill again and stood before him. ""But where is your garland?"" he asked.
""We gave it to lame Mary, the postman's wife, for she is always longing to see the fields,"" they answered; ""but these roses are for you, dear little boy; they are all for you,"" and putting them into his hands they went back to the village.
""You are very tired,"" the child said to the roses; ""all your leaves are drooping. Poor roses, perhaps you are lonely away from the garden; but you shall sleep near me, and there is a star rising up in the sky; it will watch us all through the night."" 
Then the child nestled down in his white bed—he and his little warm heart, in which there was love for all things. While he slept the roses looked at his pale little face and sighed, and presently they stole softly on to his cheeks and rested there. The children saw them still there when the summer was over; when the garland was quite dead, and lame Mary longed for the fields no more.",The Children and the Garland.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/qVfJwX6Bs3ZaWe0ykuQI5Q/Ao-1_LoqdNd9Vzzhk2GFyJaKufifoLOzyzeg-s7fCLcfoIts4-N1lWZoK9_yt7cSbPE7idT-6XFW7rbqcqlDQXQtGKqx-WIBUMQtILClFzAxE17KNXTbHxRY6dAqKbIR/cTaKw4jNG9GHKaVQzfnlbQYSkN0LQzyotoSbWobNjdo),239
Deer,2,Poem,"Oh deer, with big brown eyes so bright,
You grace the forest with your gentle sight.
With soft fur, brown as autumn leaves,
You frolic and play with nimble ease.

Take you through the woods, oh so discreet.
Your white tail, like a flag, you wave,
To warn your friends, before you escape.

Oh deer, you are a creature fair,
With a spirit free and wild, beyond compare.
You roam and graze, from morn till night,
And bring joy to those who see your flight.

I Like to Go Exploring,2,Rhyming Story,"I went up to the arctic where I met a polar bear.
You might think she’d be white, but she had purple yellow hair.

I hopped on to a glacier and I rode it out to sea.
Snow is great for sledding but it's much too cold for me.

I like to go exploring places that I've never been.
Take one step, and then another, that's how you begin.

I made it to the jungle where a toucan said “Hello!”
He made a hat from branches that he dropped to me below.

High above in vines were where the lemurs liked to swing.
They jumped around and laughed and that's when they began to sing:

We like to go exploring places that we've never been.
Take one swing, and then another, that's how we begin.

I headed to the desert where the camel keeps his humps.
He takes them off and puts them on, his fuzzy camel lumps.

We stopped at an oasis, such a magic, mystique spot,
But soon I had to leave for it was getting rather hot. 

I headed to the forest where the trees were made of gum,
And if I come that way again, I’ll chew up every one.

I hiked up to the mountains where the bobcat had her band. 
The goats and mountain lions joined the song that they had planned:

We like to go exploring places we have never been.
Take one step, and then another, that's how we begin.

And if you don't believe the words I wrote inside this song,
Take one step and then another, then go prove me wrong.",I Like to Go Exploring!.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/khVLJQAjBw9HsVbN1OWdmQ/76yH_W0NE7pRLj8E95abDxG-PCX9KHI4FxGNmNb9ckflkcbBAht8N3X9QBQyvWJVUd1SLG8R-qjwNnYpEatTBDX7NKGyEFZ4BUG2TtDN15w/bz51yAzgkKsP3DroiV_0Ngihlcipk38So2LATEZs_BY),241

    And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;

    When the meadows laugh with lively green,
    And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
    When Mary and Susan and Emily
    With their sweet round mouths sing ""Ha, ha he!""

    When the painted birds laugh in the shade,

Tommy,2,Short Story ,"Tommy was sitting on the bench near the end of the lane. By his side was a basin tied up in a cotton handkerchief; in the buttonhole of his coat there was a sprig of sweet-william. The girls from the big house came and stood still in front of him, staring at him rudely, but he did not speak.
""Tommy, are you tired?"" they asked.
""Yes,"" Tommy answered, crossly, ""I'm very tired, and father's working in the fields, and I have got to take him his dinner before I go to the fair.""
""Why don't the servants take it?""
""Servants!"" said Tommy scornfully; ""we've no servants. We are not rich people!""
""Wouldn't you like to be rich?"" the eldest sister asked, while the two little ones walked slowly round Tommy, looking at the feather in his hat; he had put it there so that he might look smart when he went on to the village.
""No, it's too expensive,"" said Tommy, shaking his head; ""rich people have to buy such a lot of things, and to wear fine clothes, and they can't have dinner in the fields.""
""My father has his dinner in a room,"" said the girl.
""That's because he's rich,"" answered Tommy, ""and people would talk if he didn't; rich people can't do as they like, as poor can.""
""And my father lives in a big house,"" the girl went on, for she was vulgar, and liked to boast.
""Yes, and it takes up a lot of room; my father's got the whole world to live in if he likes; that's better than a house.""
""But my father doesn't work,"" said the girl, scornfully.
""Mine does,"" said Tommy, proudly. ""Rich people can't work,"" he went on, ""so they are obliged to get the poor folk to do it. Why, we have made everything in the world. Oh! it's a fine thing to be poor.""
""But suppose all the rich folk died, what would the poor folk do?""
""But suppose all the poor folk died,"" cried Tommy, ""what would the rich folk do? They can sit in carriages, but can't build them, and eat dinners, but can't cook them.""

The Wolf and the Kid,2,Short Story ,"There was once a little kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone.
He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind cane creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The kid shivered as he thought of the  terrible wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the wolf!
The kid knew there was little hope for him.
""Please, Mr. Wolf,"" he said trembling, ""I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.""
The wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the kid leaped and frisked gaily.
Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.

Tense: Definition and Types,2,Informative Text,"Definition of Tense 
Tense is the way we talk about when something happens. There are three main types of tense: past, present, and future.

Types of Tense
Tense is mainly divided into three types - 1) Past, 2) Present, and 3) Future.

Past Tense is when something happened in the past. 
For example, ""I went to the park yesterday.""

Present Tense is when something is happening now. 
For example, ""I am playing with my toys.""

Future Tense is when something will happen in the future. 
For example, ""I will go to the park tomorrow.""

It's important to understand the different tenses because it helps us talk about when things happen and understand when things happen when we are listening to others.",Tense Definition and Types.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/BgRUP-PuzXS8Bo2kpVrxmw/QSDvORqFkcbyx6D7FlwwHoj76weBbjBr9zjbGlBtHhZMlG5p7L8qdnxcXgoD3xEZzYsKUtOyHGxOrptfvNH_Bs-eYYLB835Wpc0Q1U0tAfzytaomjxlsHMf0dwOCPyj-/_RVxu2Yjf4oiaJ4o_R69Chdd_piB5ex-mQk6rBLrylQ),247
"The Straw, the Coal, and the Bean",2,Short Story ,"In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and so that it might burn quicker, she lit it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. 
Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,—I should have been burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ 
‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’ ‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.
‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair to a foreign country.’
The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight across, and then you can walk over me as if on a bridge.’ 
The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther. 
The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was traveling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. 
As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.","""The Straw, the Coal, and the Bean.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/kJfyQONIbybfq9U2PxgTig/MeDvm71F82wwju560mNlRB_N_o0RVq0Le-Tyq7bNW_bBH-A_xAy6YIDXdus5llbKOaYJ6cCu1Qckef1IbTE6nqiUBtciQ0wd_fPrsETfKsEaCGnEcDldAc_8NWXykCZn/dc_Jfak_1RQeEEykYOeVb_yaTn7bGqGEvBfOWQgAGfQ)""",248
Five Little Seeds,2,Poem,"Five little seeds, in a row they lay,
Each one dreaming of a bright new day.

With petals soft and a sweet, sweet smell.""

Tall and strong, with branches free.""

Climbing high, with leaves so fine.""

""I'll wait and see what the future holds for me.""

The Poor Little Doll,2,Short Story ,"It was a plain little doll that had been bought for sixpence at a stall in the market-place. It had scanty hair and a weak composition face, a calico body and foolish feet that always turned inwards instead of outwards, and from which the sawdust now and then oozed. Yet in its glass eyes there was an expression of amusement; they seemed to be looking not at you but through you, and the pursed-up red lips were always smiling at what the glass eyes saw.
""Well, you are a doll,"" the boy said, looking up from his French exercise. ""And what are you staring at me for? Is there anything behind it?"" he asked, looking over his shoulder. The doll gave no answer. ""And whatever are you smiling for?"" he asked; ""I believe you are always smiling. I believe you'd go on if I didn't do my exercise till next year, or if the cat died, or the monument tumbled down."" 
But still the doll smiled in silence, and the boy went on with his exercise. Presently he looked up again and yawned. ""I think I'll go for a stroll,"" he said, and put his book by. ""I know what I'll do,"" he said, suddenly; ""I'll take that doll and hang it up to the apple tree to scare away the sparrows."" And calling out, ""Sis, I have taken your doll; I'm going to make a scarecrow of it,"" he went off to the garden.
His sister rushed after him, crying out, ""Oh, my poor doll! oh, my dear little doll ! What are you doing to it, you naughty boy?”
""It's so ugly,"" he said.
""No, it is not ugly,"" she cried.
“And it's so stupid, it never does anything but smile, it can't even grow, it never gets any bigger.""
“Poor darling doll,"" Sis said, as she got it once more safely into her arms, ""of course you can't grow, but it is not your fault, they did not make any tucks in you to let out.""
“And it's so unfeeling. It went away smiling like anything when I could not do my French.""
""It has no heart. Of course it can't be felt.""
“Why hasn't it got a heart?
“Because it isn't alive. You ought to be sorry for it, and very, very kind to it, poor thing."" ""Well, what is it always smiling for?"" “Because it is so good,"" answered Sis, bursting into tears. ""It is never bad-tempered; it never complains, and it never did anything unkind,"" and, kissing it tenderly, ""you are always good and sweet,"" she said, “and always look smiling, though you must be very unhappy at not being alive.""",The Poor Little Doll.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/dwok4ZSynVYqaQMHebbN6A/TWHtgITUBLzSkm33obQ4vcO3cjs34caNipvlpZgZyrVBL6yy4MWzeN0OeiGq6yXLxKcvtunoZVqd7rsVKZaQUy12l4K7as5Ekl0qWPQEK4Y/to-rxASc_NwbbqScB6JvGZ1yvggGf8dbtCZIBARgmYo),251

How to Play the Garden Gate Game,2,Reading Comprehension,"The Garden Gate is a very pretty game. A ring is formed of all the players except one, who stands in the middle. The others dance round her three times, and when they stop she begins to sing:
	""Open wide the garden gate, the garden gate, the garden gate,
	Open the garden gate and let me through.""
The circle then dances round her again, singing:
	""Get the key of the garden gate, the garden gate, the garden gate,
	Get the key of the garden gate and open and let yourself through.""
The girl inside the circle, pretending to sob, replies:
	""I've lost the key of the garden gate, the garden gate, the garden gate,
	I've lost the key to the garden gate, and cannot let myself through.""
But the dancers dance round and round her, singing:
	""Then you may stop all night within the gate, within the gate, within the gate,
	You may stop all night within the gate, unless you have strength to break through.""

The captive then rushes to the weakest part of the ring, and tries to break through by throwing her whole weight upon the clasped hands of the children, and generally contrives to break through, the one whose hand gives way being made captive in her stead.",How to Play the Garden Gate Game.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/zh3eBeZytXnO35N-aASjMA/hs7iP7i3-jXJqh6ogxxZ86G36v_f_Sln5h6tGRXtiu5HKt_8FmX5MNzSchfbwwBxnExaxsDbnNT6ealnEnfNeQ4A5lX7v1b49maoFI9bG_qnGLy4cVwZaulT5hcHoL-u/SiY6_yFj_iBjvqoaKFN_FMQNmfShw7dH8EUgKGUevJs),253

The owner of the toy shop, Mr. Smith, was a kind and generous man. He always had a big smile on his face and loved to see the children's faces light up when they saw the toys in his shop.
One day, a little girl named Emily came into the toy shop. She had always wanted to visit Toy Land, but her family couldn't afford to buy her toys. Mr. Smith saw the sadness in her eyes and knew he had to do something to make her happy.
He showed her around the shop and let her pick out any toy she wanted. Emily was so excited and couldn't decide which toy to choose. Mr. Smith told her to take her time and choose the one that made her the happiest.
After looking around for a while, Emily finally found the perfect toy. It was a beautiful doll with long brown hair and a pink dress. She hugged the doll tightly and thanked Mr. Smith for being so kind.
From that day on, Emily visited Toy Land every week and Mr. Smith always made sure she had a new toy to play with. She was always so happy and grateful for his kindness.

Waves in the Sea,2,Poem,"Waves crash against the shore,
Rising up in endless force,
The sea a restless, churning roar,
A tempest in its course.

The water swells and dips and flows,
A dance of light and dark,
A symphony of ebbs and flows,
A movement wild and stark.

The waves crash hard and break apart,
A burst of foam and spray,
A constant beating of the heart,
Of nature at its play.

The sea is wild and deep and wide,
A mystery to explore,
And in its depths we cannot hide,
But find ourselves once more.

Lily loved nothing more than to frolic in the meadows and play among the wildflowers. She would dance with the butterflies and sing with the birds, and the forest creatures adored her. But there was one thing that made her different from all the other fairies in the forest - she had a kind heart.
One day, while flying through the forest, Lily came across a group of animals who were in trouble. A fierce storm had blown down many of the trees, and they had nowhere to go. Without hesitation, Lily offered to help the animals. She used her magic to create a warm and cozy home for them, and soon they were all safe and sound.
The animals were so grateful to Lily that they decided to repay her kindness. They worked together to build her the most beautiful fairy house that anyone had ever seen. It was made of acorn caps, pebbles, and wildflowers, and it shone like a star in the night sky.
From that day on, the forest creatures would often visit Lily in her fairy house, and she would tell them stories and sing them songs. She became known as the guardian of the forest, and her kindness and generosity spread throughout the land.
Years went by, and the fairy child grew into a fairy queen. She ruled her kingdom with love and compassion, and all of the creatures in the forest lived in peace and harmony.

In Space,2,Rhyming Story,"I’ve decided I’m moving. I’m running away.
I’m bored of this room and I’d rather not stay.

The best place to live for a girl such as me,
Is space, with no rules, and no grav-ity.

My cat Bill and I will need astronaut suits.
Our feet will be fine if we take some snow boots.

We’ll wear yellow gloves that you use to wash dishes.
And bowls on our heads where we used to keep fishes.

I know that it’s s’posed to be called a fishbowl.
But no fish are left since Bill swallowed ‘em whole.

For our bodies I have found us some trash bags to wear.
With our shiny new suits, we will be quite the pair!

Now the spaceship dilemma is easy to fix,
I built one last summer… you know, just for kicks.

Space is enormous, you can fly all around.
I bet I’ll see planets that nobody’s found!

As for space monsters, I am not that afraid.
A monster’s a friend that you haven’t yet made.

First thing I’ll do is go looking for Saturn.
And fly through its rings in my zag and zig pattern.

Next I’ll go zipping by Venus and Mars.
It’s easy since spaceships are faster than cars.

Bill thinks that Neptune has birds everywhere.
He’d be rather mad, if we didn’t stop there.

Mercury seems like a great place to tan.
But it might be too hot if I don’t pack a fan.

When I’m hungry, I’ll munch on some Jupiter fruit.
I hope that the juice doesn’t drip on my suit.

On Uranus I’ll put on a wonderful play.
The whole solar system can come — if they pay.

It’s freezing on Pluto, especially at night.
But it’s famous for hosting the best snowball fight.

Eventually, I will fly back to the Earth.
It’s really quite beautiful, for what it’s worth.

In fact, there’s no rush to explore space just yet…
There are creatures down here that I still haven’t met.

I can’t help but dream about all that’s in space.
But for now I’ll enjoy what is here in this place.",In Space.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/SaS6vTlbwdOg57U1pxUjjA/egx1OIw9cLdADH-mGu_aJUWSd9g_Hh-8Ncgs2oc3U2Wuk4VZBz7xt4XTaqBr4AHvET6yPS3L4HxpPXZSCcmlNv_buPmMvgMvXGqwIo9hhus/e_TW4nm4pPKT0cGA_ZVdOpS5fvd8NweJhFphRivkjkY),264

A Child's Fancy,2,Poem,"O little flowers, you love me so,
You could not do without me;
O little birds that come and go,
You sing sweet songs about me;
O little moss, observed by few,
That round the tree is creeping,
You like my head to rest on you,
When I am idly sleeping.


O rushes by the river side,
You bow when I come near you;
O fish, you leap about with pride,
Because you think I hear you;
O river, you shine clear and bright,
To tempt me to look in you;
O water-lilies, pure and white,
You hope that I shall win you.


O pretty things, you love me so,
I see I must not leave you;
You'd find it very dull, I know,
I should not like to grieve you.
Don't wrinkle up, you silly moss;
My flowers, you need not shiver;
My little buds, don't look so cross;
Don't talk so loud, my river.


And I will make a promise, dears,
That will content you, maybe;
I'll love you through the happy years,
Till I'm a nice old lady!
True love (like yours and mine) they say
Can never think of ceasing,
But year by year, and day by day,
Keeps steadily increasing.",A Child's Fancy.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/4Bqd_KRCZvWJesoZoJOWjw/2PWB00-BLszUiYW4dZLYuXTtpbmllfFlvLxC1cI62IK003LobN3e3M4SiObeackNy-Z6G34ZcWDrecMvrzxj8RPSNxtyYTNJEEV9AWqVSo8/-kPvwFC9CoZC_L__N6FCX9yi2BXjvgbgpehO5nqaw-s),268

A Blessing for the Blessed,2,Poem,"When the sun has left the hill-top
And the daisy fringe is furled,
When the birds from wood and meadow
In their hidden nests are curled,
Then I think of all the babies
That are sleeping in the world.

There are babies in the high lands
And babies in the low,
There are pale ones wrapped in furry skins
On the margin of the snow,
And brown ones naked in the isles
Where all the spices grow.

And some are in the palace
On a white and downy bed,
And some are in the garret
With a clout beneath their head,
And some are on the cold hard earth,
Whose mothers have no bread.

O little men and women,
Dear flowers yet unblown —
O little kings and beggars
Of the pageant yet unshown —
Sleep soft and dream pale dreams now,
To-morrow is your own.",A Blessing for the Blessed.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/U3REIi9tzZ392mQKQx95Pg/jkNmEmKknI-Y7FQzUijsh-e0KFppviL0IsGEWTdoj8EoK1JxvAdrB83aXDLqkfh421fXb5TzMJmT2dcxbxnu08Yj1Eb-kVT3gaDDHTgtwYvstBY1pGdv6lSVdt_wKf-e/Qk4oI1Ff8YY_EyLnVrgIxaxZVBsM9dVPxjyNHSVJgLo),271
Hercules and the Wagoner,2,Short Story ,"A farmer was driving his wagon along a miry country road after a heavy rain. The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a rut.
The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the rut. All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid. Then it is said, Hercules really did appear saying,
""Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself.""
And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon moved very rapidly, and soon the farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned.

Moral of the story is that self help is the best help. Heaven helps those who help themselves.",Hercules and the Wagoner.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/xaVqiFOPwbeuQhmww5j9Rg/0cPgxIWFSidjlt-u05yfN8gcFK_0mRdUUkP8_D2S1A9Sv2OQ9KNTKS1ZmfrXRHYM-CHV_q3z9Q9LE6kTMhnUhQDHtf87RERqv61lJ7yXgNCsOC6rmOG0iFd_-5r8wBOS/90duTKnKRF39KseImEj87-oCHNmWfRRdGfe9Zw6wNvI),272
A Girl Who Didn't Like Reading,2,Short Story,"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. Sarah loved to learn new things, but she didn't like reading books. She thought reading was boring and she couldn't understand what was written in the books.
One day, her teacher, Mrs. Smith, asked her class to read a book every day. Sarah was worried because she didn't like reading, but she didn't want to disappoint her teacher.
So, she decided to give it a try and picked up a book. To her surprise, she found that the story was about a magical land with talking animals and a brave hero. She was so fascinated by the story that she read the whole book in one day.
From that day on, Sarah started reading a book every day. She discovered that books were not boring after all. In fact, books were full of amazing stories, fascinating facts and new adventures.
Sarah's reading improved so much that she became the best reader in her class. Her teacher was very proud of her and so were her parents. Sarah realized that reading was not only fun, but also helped her to become more knowledgeable and imaginative.
From that day on, Sarah never looked back. She became an avid reader and loved to share her favorite books with her friends and family.

The Zoo,2,Poem,"Bars and cages, a prison for beasts,
A zoo, a spectacle for human feasts.

Wild creatures trapped, on display for all,
Their freedom lost, their natural call.

Elephants pacing, lions in despair,
A life of captivity, without a care.

Bears pacing, monkeys in a daze,
All here for our entertainment,
In a never ending phase.

But do we ever stop to think,
Of the harm we cause, on the brink?

These animals belong in the wild,
Not trapped and caged, like a child.

So let us all take a stand,
For the animals held in this man-made land.

And work towards a world, where they're free,
Where zoos no longer exist, and all can see,
The true beauty of nature, and all it holds,
For the sake of the animals, and their welfare, let's be bold.",The Zoo.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/qAaOQyLxYA-I27aSTbQSPw/H3cbeCVw8ThiTfWKKAdBdTyvoYCmmX1ksYp3KlOOYrrVvs4UmU5E_-FLTvwl4fjHnYMIXxsTnmy2dE0XuZfwtqMcpNV36YLXinU2e44rkDU/OpUvws61BW6WOIAwC6860CVsOGfP37Rh37TQviu6wC8),274
The Duck Pond,2,Short Story ,"So little Bridget took the baby on her right arm and a jug in her left hand, and went to the farm to get the milk. On her way she went by the garden-gate of a large house that stood close to the farm, and she told the baby a story:—
“Last summer,” she said, “a little girl, bigger than you, for she was just able to walk, came to stay in that house—she and her father and mother. All about the road just here, the ducks and the chickens from the farm, and an old turkey, used to walk about all the day long, but the poor little ducks were very unhappy, for they had no pond to swim about in, only that narrow ditch through which the streamlet is flowing.
Bridget continued saying,  “When the little girl's father saw this, he took a spade, and worked and worked very hard, and out of the ditch and the streamlet he made a little pond for the ducks, and they swam about and were very happy all through the summer days. Every morning I used to stand and watch, and presently the garden-gate would open, and then the father would come out, leading the little girl by the hand, and the mother brought a large plateful of bits of broken bread.”
According to Bridget, “The little girl used to throw the bread to the ducks, and they ran after it and ate it up quickly, while she laughed out with glee, and the father and the mother laughed too just as merrily. Baby, the father had blue eyes, and a voice that you seemed to hear with your heart.’’
“The little girl used to feed the chickens too, and the foolish old turkey that was so fond of her it would run after her until she screamed and was afraid. The dear father and the little girl came out every morning, while the black pigs looked through the bars of the farm-yard gate and grunted at them, as if they were glad, and I think the ducks knew that the father had made the pond, for they swam round and round it proudly while he watched them, but when he went away they seemed tired and sad.”, Bridget added to the story.
Bridget completed the story saying, “The pond is not there now, baby, for a man came by one day and made it into a ditch again; and the chickens and the ducks from the farm are kept in another place. The little girl is far away in her own home, which the father made for her, and the dear father lives in his own home too—in the hearts of those he loved.”
That was the story that Bridget told the baby.",The Duck Pond.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/bvDJbLpIxFZPyWw5pDwxsQ/GgeZOn6EJ9YmEZtEqnVjO2jddAtVlHuKsIwSGbo7wB8u1HsNqHZU3qfsfCu340NvlMXGMD1RBFFevHSn3GnZO7N72ppYeVbl7_DtBOuzWEA/GEoxIjVPCfSiMSaHwM5WnnbW3LnhF3XVRwapTBn43NY),275

Pirates,2,Poem,"Sailors of the sea, with a flag unfurled,
Adventure in their hearts, and treasure to be hurled.

They'll take what they desire, and play their deadly game.

With a ship as their home, and the wind in their sails,
They'll roam the seven seas, and leave behind their trails.
They'll plunder and loot, with a fierce battle cry,
And leave their foes to die, beneath the endless sky.

Importance of Cleanliness,2,Reading Comprehension,"Cleanliness is an essential aspect of a healthy and prosperous society. It is the foundation of good hygiene and plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of disease. A clean environment not only improves the health of individuals but also enhances the overall quality of life.

One of the most significant benefits of cleanliness is the prevention of disease. When the environment is clean, it is less likely for germs and bacteria to spread, reducing the risk of illnesses. This is particularly important in public places, such as hospitals and schools, where large numbers of people gather.

Cleanliness also improves the aesthetics of an area. A clean and well-maintained environment is more pleasing to the eye and can create a sense of pride in the community. This, in turn, can lead to more civic engagement and a stronger sense of community.

Another benefit of cleanliness is the economic impact it can have. A clean environment can attract businesses and tourists, leading to economic growth and job creation. Additionally, a clean environment can improve property values and increase the overall value of a community.

However, cleanliness is not only the responsibility of government and municipal authorities, it is also the responsibility of each and every individual. Every person has a role to play in maintaining a clean environment. This can be done by properly disposing of trash, keeping public spaces free of litter, and practicing good personal hygiene.

In conclusion, cleanliness is an essential aspect of a healthy and prosperous society. It plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of disease, improving the aesthetics of an area, and having a positive economic impact. It is the responsibility of government, municipal authorities, and individuals to work together to maintain a clean environment.

About Angels,2,Short Story ,"OTHER,"" said the child; ""are there really angels?"" ""The Good Book says so,"" said the mother. ""Yes,"" said the child; ""I have seen the picture. But did you ever see one, mother?""' ""I think I have,"" said the mother; ""but she was not dressed like the picture.""
""I am going to find one!"" said the child. ""I am going to run along the road, miles, and miles, and miles, until I find an angel."" ""'That will be a good plan!"" said the mother. ""And I will go with you, for you are too little to run far alone.""
""I am not little any more!"" said the child. ""I have trousers; I am big."" ""So you are!"" said the mother. ""I forgot. But it is a fine day, and I should like the walk."" ""But you walk so slowly, with your lame foot."" ""I can walk faster than you think!"" said the mother.
So they started, the child leaping and running, and the mother stepping out so bravely with her lame foot that the child soon forgot about it. 
The child danced on ahead, and presently he saw a chariot coming towards him, drawn by prancing white horses. In the chariot sat a splendid lady in velvet and furs, with white plumes waving above her dark hair. As she moved in her seat, she flashed with jewels and gold, but her eyes were brighter than her diamonds.
""Are you an angel?"" asked the child, running up beside the chariot. The lady made no reply, but stared coldly at the child: then she spoke a word to her coachman, and he flicked his whip, and the chariot rolled away swiftly in a cloud of dust, and disappeared.
The dust filled the child's eyes and mouth, and made him choke and sneeze. He gasped for breath, and rubbed his eyes; but presently his mother came up, and wiped away the dust with her blue gingham apron.
""That was not an angel!"" said the child. ""No, indeed!"" said the mother. ""Nothing like one!""
The child danced on again, leaping and running from side to side of the road, and the mother followed as best she might. By and by the child met a most beautiful maiden, clad in a white dress. Her eyes were like blue stars, and the blushes came and went in her face like roses looking through snow.
""I am sure you must be an angel!"" cried the child. The maiden blushed more sweetly than before. ""You dear little child!"" she cried. ""Someone else said that, only last evening. Do I really look like an angel?""
""You are  an angel!"" said the child. The maiden took him up in her arms and kissed him, and held him tenderly. ""You are the dearest little thing I ever saw!"" she said. ""Tell me what makes you think so!"" But suddenly her face changed.
""Oh!"" she cried. ""There he is, coming to meet me! And you have soiled my white dress with your dusty shoes, and pulled my hair all awry. Run away, child, and go home to your mother!""
She set the child down, not unkindly, but so hastily that he stumbled and fell; but she did not see that, for she was hastening forward to meet her lover, who was coming along the road. (Now if the maiden had only known, he thought her twice as lovely with the child in her arms; but she did not know.)
The child lay in the dusty road and sobbed, till his mother came along and picked him up, and wiped away the tears with her blue gingham apron.
""I don't believe that was an angel, after all,"" he said. ""No!"" said the mother. ""But she may be one someday. She is still young yet."" ""I am tired!"" said the child. ""Will you carry me home, mother?"" ""Why, yes!"" said the mother. ""That is what I came for.""
The child put his arms around his mother's neck, and she held him tight and trudged along the road, singing the song he liked best. Suddenly he looked up in her face. ""Mother,"" he said; ""I don't suppose you  could be an angel, could you?""
""Oh, what a foolish child!"" said the mother. ""Who ever heard of an angel in a blue gingham apron?"" and she went on singing, and stepped out so bravely on her lame foot that no one would ever have known she was lame.",About Angels.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Ppm0q2KJARJ7ukfek8oWgA/Sjq_BLBvyrQ0Y13NwMpXuLX02wLeQRTdrca3eGqvMEMiTMO0yYBCJjQJM9OEWJ-Ctnr3hpRRFXXoePoaukX6S47PeiFbCi_hvdJWPpodaU8/_OQVqcBpDnr6gtmnSSsP17bDbHFBZCHrgeCNK8awBrI),279

And the first white butterfly
In the sunshine dances by.

English Language,2,Informative Text,"The English language is a West Germanic language that originated in England and is now the most widely spoken language in the world. It is the official language in many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
English has a rich history and has been influenced by many other languages, including Latin, French, and German. This has resulted in a diverse vocabulary, with many words borrowed from other languages.
One of the unique features of the English language is its flexibility. It can be used in a variety of contexts, from formal to informal settings. Additionally, it has a relatively simple grammar system, making it easy for non-native speakers to learn.
In recent years, English has become the global language of business, science, and technology. This is due in part to the dominance of American culture and the widespread use of the internet, which has made it easier for people around the world to communicate in English.

An Ass and a Lapdog,2,Short Story ,"A man had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. The Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat. 
The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master’s house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could. 
He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back. 
The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. 
The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: “I have brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all day like that useless little Lapdog!”",An Ass and a Lapdog.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Pbu7yEzVRlzbW4pkRlUYMg/D8csCqjTHQsHygCzeYZRFc_OQMCnZw0X-fDBFJruYhuPJGYIeycigrgHs-9o9_2AdZys-1jVX4RsZgSEM_uQJpWpte8zXPylr_LqBPBbEGc/M9XZSz4omfgK96LgTkuqbe2iU02Ijz9PhIU-0pIJzu8),282

Daisy and Her Ducklings,2,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a small pond nestled in the heart of a forest, lived a family of ducks. The mother duck, named Daisy, had three little ducklings: Peter, Paul, and Mary. They spent their days swimming and playing in the pond, diving for bugs, and basking in the sun.

One day, while the family was out for a swim, a hunter came into the forest. He saw the pond and the ducks swimming in it and decided to take a shot. Daisy quickly noticed the hunter and knew that she had to protect her ducklings. She quickly gathered them under her wings and paddled as fast as she could towards the reeds at the edge of the pond.

The hunter fired his gun, but Daisy and her ducklings managed to make it to the reeds and hide. The hunter searched the pond, but the ducks were nowhere to be found. Daisy and her ducklings had managed to escape.

After the hunter left, Daisy and her ducklings swam back to the middle of the pond. They were shaken but safe. Daisy hugged her ducklings and told them, ""I will always protect you, no matter what.""

From that day on, Daisy made sure to teach her ducklings how to be safe and aware of their surroundings. They continued to live happily in the pond, swimming and playing together, always staying close to the reeds in case danger came near.",Daisy and Her Ducklings.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/hDjC3QIg5UpjIZh0MbrBGg/L-HLCCBONWyYvnmzVCjhq9qmbITaUSzbX09aHRwcS-AXayvq_E2Htkugw9xC7t3Gp6rMCTlScRiHNfw3ai6jErlKTC51qr8DHHd0E2wd2lw/hOocfgdADpVZAeuPnYOFQw1scKzTxKeiW0LI2zCfLU0),285

There lies a city, ever fair,
With streets of gold and buildings rare.

And every smile is a warm embrace.

And magic and beauty never bends.

And the night is always bright and free,

And happiness is always here.

And the heart is open and never hides,

"The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass",2,Short Story ,"A Miller and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair to sell him. They had not gone far when they met with a troop of women collected round a well, talking and laughing. 
“Look there,” cried one of them, “did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the road on foot when they might ride?”  The old man hearing this, quickly made his son mount the Ass, and continued to walk along merrily by his side. 
Presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate. “There,” said one of them, “it proves what I was a-saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man rest his weary limbs.” 
Upon this the old man made his son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children: “Why, you lazy old fellow,” cried several tongues at once, “how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?” 
The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost reached the town. “Pray, honest friend,” said a citizen, “is that Ass your own?” “Yes,” replied the old man. “O, one would not have thought so,” said the other, “by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you.” “Anything to please you,” said the old man; “we can but try.”
So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. 
Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain.","""The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/NMtXQyxWOQXy4HrtNykFfA/Up08EeCYe9-NH33J6FLp_dnKLaMZyhXFmK-fcxcZxCEl6nnXAxdmUyZhrtjH1Sl9KQVOHsUKYWeRZD5DlLzzhh_4BqesJE76EgyUUv8dVLOmlu6crYBkwlaRpcDmM36k/Jv6h62EdCisGHETgYOWhiTCkEmYIouBu7EaTW88Unng)""",288

The predicate is the action or state of being described in the sentence.
Examples
For example, in the sentence ""The dog ran,"" ""dog"" is the subject and ""ran"" is the predicate.

Timmy's parents were very proud of him and often told him how much they loved him. They knew that he would grow up to be a responsible and successful adult because of the values he had learned from a young age.
One day, a new family moved into the village and their son, Billy, was Timmy's age. Billy was a bit of a troublemaker and often got into trouble for not listening to his parents or for not following the rules. Timmy saw that Billy was struggling and decided to take him under his wing and show him how to be a good child.

As the world awakens, just for me.

Of pink and orange, blue and hues.

Stand in stillness, without a care.

But my heart is filled with warm repose.

As I walk, taking in the wintry wreath.

Searching for food, as they fly by.

Turtles,2,Reading Comprehension,"Turtles are one of the oldest creatures on Earth. They have been around for more than 200 million years. They are known for their hard shells that protect them from predators.
There are many different types of turtles, such as sea turtles, box turtles, and even a giant turtle called the leatherback turtle. Sea turtles are known for their long journeys across the ocean, while box turtles are found in wooded areas and gardens.
Turtles are slow-moving animals, and they can live for a long time. Some turtles can live for more than 100 years! They are also known to be very gentle creatures and are not harmful to humans.
Turtles also play an important role in the ecosystem. For example, sea turtles help to keep the ocean clean by eating jellyfish and other creatures. They also help to spread coral reefs by eating the coral and then excreting the pieces elsewhere.
However, turtles face many threats such as habitat loss, pollution, and hunting. This is why it is important to protect turtles and their habitats. We can do this by not polluting the oceans, not hunting turtles, and preserving their habitats.
In conclusion, turtles are fascinating creatures that have been around for millions of years.

The Monkey and the Dolphin,2,Short Story ,"It happened once upon a time that a certain Greek ship bound for Athens was wrecked off the coast close to Piraeus, the port of Athens. Had it not been for the dolphins, who at that time were very friendly toward mankind and especially toward Athenians, all would have perished. But the dolphins took the shipwrecked people on their backs and swam with them to shore.
Now it was the custom among the Greeks to take their pet monkeys and dogs with them whenever they went on a voyage. So when one of the dolphins saw a monkey struggling with water, he thought it was a man, and made the monkey climb up on his back. Then off he swam with him toward the shore.
The monkey sat up, grave and dignified, on the dolphin's back.
""You are a citizen of illustrious Athens, are you not?"" Asked the dolphin politely.
""Yes,"" answered the monkey, proudly. ""My family is one of the noblest in the city.""
""Indeed,"" said the dolphin. ""Then of course you often visit Piraeus.""
""Yes, yes,"" replied the monkey. ""Indeed, I do. I am with him constantly. Piraeus is my very best friend.""
This answer took the dolphin by surprise, and, turning his head, he now saw what it was he was carrying. Without more ado, he dived and left the foolish monkey to take care of himself, while he swam off in search of some human being to save.

The king thought for a moment and then said, ""I wish for a palace even more beautiful and grand than this one."" The genie snapped his fingers and a magnificent palace appeared before the king's eyes. The king was amazed and thanked the genie.
The king's second wish was for a magic carpet that could take him anywhere in the world. The genie granted this wish as well, and the king was overjoyed.

From that day on, King Suleiman ruled his kingdom with even greater wisdom and fairness, and his people loved and respected him even more. The genie, happy to have helped the king, disappeared into the magic carpet, but promised to come back whenever the king needed him.

Then the elder sister took up the fairy story again, to see how many things were left out, for those, she thought, would go into her book. The little one said to herself, ""Really, it is no good thinking about kings and queens until I have known some, so I must wait;"" and while the brother was considering the pig, and the pony, and the white rabbit, he fell asleep.

Reddy Fox Growing Old,3,Short Story ,"Reddy Fox was growing bold. Everybody said so, and what everybody says must be so. Reddy Fox had always been very sly and not bold at all. The truth is Reddy Fox had so many times fooled Bowser the Hound and Farmer Brown's boy that he had begun to think himself very smart indeed. He had really fooled himself. Yes, Sir, Reddy Fox had fooled himself. He thought himself so smart that nobody could fool him.
Now it is one of the worst habits in the world to think too much of one's self. And Reddy Fox had the habit. Oh, my, yes! Reddy Fox certainly did have the habit! When anyone mentioned Bowser the Hound, Reddy would turn up his nose and say: “Pooh! It's the easiest thing in the world to fool him.”
You see, he had forgotten all about the time Bowser had fooled him at the railroad bridge.
Whenever Reddy saw Farmer Brown's boy he would say with the greatest scorn: “Who's afraid of him? Not I!”
So as Reddy Fox thought more and more of his own smartness, he grew bolder and bolder. Almost every night he visited Farmer Brown's henyard. Farmer Brown set traps all around the yard, but Reddy always found them and kept out of them. It got so that Unc' Billy Possum and Jimmy Skunk didn't dare go to the henhouse for eggs any more, for fear that they would get into one of the traps set for Reddy Fox. Of course they missed those fresh eggs and of course they blamed Reddy Fox.
“Never mind,” said Jimmy Skunk, scowling down on the Green Meadows where Reddy Fox was taking a sunbath, “Farmer Brown's boy will get him yet! I hope he does!” Jimmy said this a little spitefully and just as if he really meant it.
Now when people think that they are very, very smart, they like to show off. You know it isn't any fun at all to feel smart unless others can see how smart you are. So Reddy Fox, just to show off, grew very bold, very bold indeed. He actually went up to Farmer Brown's henyard in broad daylight, and almost under the nose of Bowser the Hound he caught the pet chicken of Farmer Brown's boy. 'Ol Mistah Buzzard, sailing overhead high up in the blue, blue sky, saw Reddy Fox and shook his bald head:
“Ah see Trouble on the way; Yes, Ah do! Yes, Ah do! Hope it ain't a-gwine to stay; Yes, Ah do! Yes, Ah do! Trouble am a spry ol' man, Bound to find yo' if he can; If he finds yo' bound to stick. When Ah sees him, Ah runs quick! Yes, Ah do! Yes, Ah do!”
But Reddy Fox thought himself so smart that it seemed as if he really were hunting for Ol' Mr. Trouble. And when he caught the pet chicken of Farmer Brown's boy, Ol' Mr. Trouble was right at his heels.",Reddy Fox Growing Old.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Zxbv0nDPkT8w_Eq86ir6mQ/slRw8ZUOe6goHvncuwttffhaXisen_zvoc7imI-cewdKckYktb5-hbDNKbl7EapbF__f_7y436iBRrAOkgtSlnb-AezbVVGJaFtxdiafpUU/ngLW101McnRN3fLiXkvDW5xRzvrb6hc6pb8kCRR93Eo),301
The Traveler,3,Poem,"As I rode in to Burrumbeet,
I met a man with funny feet;
And, when I paused to ask him why
His feet were strange, he rolled his eye
And said the rain would spoil the wheat;
So I rode on to Burrumbeet.

As I rode in to Beetaloo,
I met a man whose nose was blue;
And when I asked him how he got
A nose like that, he answered, ""What
Do bullocks mean when they say 'Moo'?""
So I rode on to Beetaloo.

As I rode in to Ballarat,
I met a man who wore no hat;
And, when I said he might take cold,
He cried, ""The hills are quite as old
As yonder plains, but not so flat.""

As I rode in to Gundagai,
I met a man and passed him by
Without a nod, without a word.
He turned, and said he'd never heard
Or seen a man so wise as I.
But I rode on to Gundagai.

The Light on the Hills,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the hills, there was a young girl named Lila. Lila was known for her bright and curious nature, always eager to explore the world around her.
One day, while wandering through the hills, Lila stumbled upon a small cave. Intrigued, she ventured inside and found that the cave was filled with a soft, warm light. The light seemed to be coming from a small crystal embedded in the cave wall.
Lila was fascinated by the crystal, and she spent hours in the cave studying it. She noticed that the light seemed to change with the time of day, becoming brighter in the morning and dimmer at night.
As she grew older, Lila became determined to figure out the mystery of the crystal. She spent every free moment in the cave, studying the light and its patterns. She even started to notice that the light seemed to have a calming effect on her, and she felt a sense of peace whenever she was in the cave.
Years passed, and Lila became an expert on the crystal. She discovered that the crystal was a rare mineral that only existed in the hills, and that it was capable of absorbing and storing sunlight during the day, and then releasing it at night. Lila shared her findings with the villagers and they were amazed.
They asked Lila to light up the village with the crystals, and so Lila worked tirelessly to extract more crystals from the hills and to create a system to light up the village at night.
The village was now a brighter and happier place, and Lila's discovery had changed the lives of the villagers forever. From that day on, the village was known as the ""Village of Light"" and Lila was hailed as a hero.
Years went by and Lila passed away, but her legacy lived on. The village continued to use the crystals to light up the streets, and Lila's cave became a popular tourist destination. Visitors from all over the world came to see the crystal and to experience the peaceful light that Lila had discovered.
The light on the hills had brought light to the village and it was a reminder of Lila's curiosity and determination that had changed the village forever.",The Light on the Hills.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/hix30sGAvB-Vs97bq8DOJQ/-q7fa_RxqHZPaIIjpD94qCqKd-tPexEgSI8hIVhCsVAEN6SrFbFEhvPds8aVlzSNcHh4aNam6T325oFxhIAaDQeRObfZy-ppO-cEHetI_9Q/_BoJTVmTHojuh2Q0zV1H64oDoOYpH89yuj6RrE0KKd4),304
Television,3,Poem,"Television, the glowing box we adore
A window to the world, forevermore
From news to sports, to shows galore
It entertains us, forevermore

With just a click, a flip of a switch
We're transported to a different pitch
A story unfolds before our eyes
A world of make-believe, no need to disguise

We laugh, we cry, we sit in awe
As we watch the characters on the raw
We're captivated by the plot and cast
A bond that seems to forever last

But as we stare into the screen
We often forget what might have been
A life lived outside, in the sun
A world waiting, for us to run

So let us not get lost in the show
But use it as a break, and then go

Global Warming,3,Informative Text,"Global warming is a big problem that is happening all around the world. It is when the Earth's temperature gets hotter and hotter, and it is caused by people using too much energy and burning things like coal, oil, and gas. This releases special gasses into the air called greenhouse gasses, which trap heat from the sun and make the Earth warmer.
Some of the effects of global warming include rising sea levels, more extreme weather like storms and droughts, and changes in the patterns of plants and animals. These effects can be dangerous for people and the environment.
To stop global warming, we need to reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses we release into the air. One way to do this is by using more clean energy like solar and wind power instead of fossil fuels. We can also make sure our buildings and cars are more energy-efficient. It's also important to plant more trees and protect existing forests because they help absorb carbon dioxide from the air.
Another way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is by reducing the amount of meat and dairy products we eat. These products create a lot of emissions during their production.
It's important to remember that global warming is a problem that affects everyone, and it's going to take effort from everyone to solve it. Each and every one of us can make small changes in our daily life to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down global warming.
Overall, global warming is a serious problem that requires urgent action. We must take steps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and make a transition towards clean energy. We all have a role to play in this, and by working together, we can create a sustainable future for ourselves and for the planet.",Global Warming.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/8DsDGqeVJdLJNrcje2AbRw/kySbMRvKif3Jv0_Nt_2Pvu_B24N1TedPE-Z2hHSGKMx4ukSHKGoqP5k2oBadOHZctwAGaDKXv9umQ1znLuour45nmD3C1ZWIavZg5qTkJH0/HQjY04gLWjECrMWZX0-3KCTP8VvityBvEbTEXvxbB7M),306
The Goat's Ears of the Emperor Trojan,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time there lived an emperor whose name was Trojan, and he had ears like a goat. Every morning, when he was shaved, he asked if the man saw anything odd about him, and as each fresh barber always replied that the emperor had goat’s ears, he was at once ordered to be put to death.
Now after this state of things had lasted a good while, there was hardly a barber left in the town that could shave the emperor, and it came to be the turn of the Master of the Company of Barbers to go up to the palace. But, unluckily, at the very moment that he should have set out, the master fell suddenly ill, and told one of his apprentices that he must go in his stead.
When the youth was taken to the emperor’s bedroom, he was asked why he had come and not his master. The young man replied that the master was ill, and there was no one but himself who could be trusted with the honour. 
The emperor was satisfied with the answer, and sat down, and let a sheet of fine linen be put round him. Directly the young barber began his work, he, like the rest, remarked the goat’s ears of the emperor, but when he had finished and the emperor asked his usual question as to whether the youth had noticed anything odd about him, the young man replied calmly, ‘No, nothing at all.’ This pleased the emperor so much that he gave him twelve ducats, and said, ‘Henceforth you shall come every day to shave me.’
So when the apprentice returned home, and the master inquired how he had got on with the emperor, the young man answered, ‘Oh, very well, and he says I am to shave him every day, and he has given me these twelve ducats’; but he said nothing about the goat’s ears of the emperor.
From this time the apprentice went regularly up to the palace, receiving each morning twelve ducats in payment. But after a while, his secret, which he had carefully kept, burnt within him, and he longed to tell it to somebody. His master saw there was something on his mind, and asked what it was. The youth replied that he had been tormenting himself for some months, and should never feel easy until some one shared his secret.
‘Well, trust me,’ said the master, ‘I will keep it to myself; or, if you do not like to do that, confess it to your pastor, or go into some field outside the town and dig a hole, and, after you have dug it, kneel down and whisper your secret three times into the hole. Then put back the earth and come away.’
The apprentice thought that this seemed the best plan, and that very afternoon went to a meadow outside the town, dug a deep hole, then knelt and whispered to it three times over, ‘The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears.’ And as he said so a great burden seemed to roll off him, and he shovelled the earth carefully back and ran lightly home.
Weeks passed away, and there sprang up in the hole an elder tree which had three stems, all as straight as poplars. Some shepherds, tending their flocks near by, noticed the tree growing there, and one of them cut down a stem to make flutes of; but, directly he began to play, the flute would do nothing but sing: ‘The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears.’ Of course, it was not long before the whole town knew of this wonderful flute and what it said; and, at last, the news reached the emperor in his palace. He instantly sent for the apprentice and said to him:
‘What have you been saying about me to all my people?’
The culprit tried to defend himself by saying that he had never told anyone what he had noticed; but the emperor, instead of listening, only drew his sword from its sheath, which so frightened the poor fellow that he confessed exactly what he had done, and how he had whispered the truth three times to the earth, and how in that very place an elder tree had sprung up, and flutes had been cut from it, which would only repeat the words he had said. 
Then the emperor commanded his coach to be made ready, and he took the youth with him, and they drove to the spot, for he wished to see for himself whether the young man’s confession was true; but when they reached the place only one stem was left. So the emperor desired his attendants to cut him a flute from the remaining stem, and, when it was ready, he ordered his chamberlain to play on it. 
But no tune could the chamberlain play, though he was the best flute player about the court—nothing came but the words, ‘The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears.’ Then the emperor knew that even the earth gave up its secrets, and he granted the young man his life, but he never allowed him to be his barber any more.",The Goat's Ears of the Emperor Trojan.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/gYHW31D7AaTWD324An9XDA/wrvW8ziB04QEt0ogEECOsKlq30_b8DI6MaR7toAEJxSJV-L8r_FbHUedcomhXpAXJpqlF_Y0oRxj_cqtXnEmJldUr5HfQ9ccauvhKyWolknqFydipAy-dFx8VIgX_Cua/U6HlB4P5fWZBBOt611TGOcyfGqzj3S2_YCGm2ervbZo),307

Formal and Informal English,3,Informative Text,"Formal and informal English are two different ways of communicating in the English language. Formal English is used in situations that require a level of formality and professionalism, such as in a business setting, a courtroom, or an academic setting. Informal English, on the other hand, is used in more casual or relaxed situations, such as with friends or family, in a casual conversation, or in text messages or social media posts.
One of the main differences between formal and informal English is the level of formality in the language used. Formal English uses a more formal and precise vocabulary, and the grammar and sentence structure is often more complex. Informal English, on the other hand, uses a more casual and relaxed vocabulary, and the grammar and sentence structure is often simpler. For example, in formal English, one might say ""I am in receipt of your letter"" while in informal English, one might say ""I got your letter"".
Another difference between formal and informal English is the use of contractions. Contractions are shortened forms of words, such as ""don't"" instead of ""do not"", and are commonly used in informal English. In formal English, contractions are generally not used, and full forms of words are used instead.
Pronouns also tend to differ between formal and informal English. In formal English, third-person pronouns such as ""he"", ""she"", ""it"", and ""they"" are often used. In informal English, first-person pronouns such as ""I"" and ""we"" are often used, as well as second-person pronouns such as ""you"".
In terms of tone, Formal English is often more objective, neutral, and impersonal, while Informal English is often more subjective, personal, and friendly.
In summary, formal and informal English are two different ways of communicating in the English language. Formal English is used in situations that require a level of formality and professionalism, while informal English is used in more casual or relaxed situations. The main differences between the two include the level of formality in the language used, the use of contractions, the use of pronouns, and the tone.",Formal and Informal English.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/iArw1FLqy1Dwu3WvnuDcvw/pMuJGHyWBkvmfgVs1EgPPX2VZEi3W0XCqsIh6uzgFtrI8xPYna_-_lBMXM2FocetEXDxNJ5TunpyL0iIGT8-_PxjM2ukYnQUz7lZKbaSoCPWvXm1tqRl0cGagzusGRZj/BCTZOFvKHdujPpgt5B1T5uysg_lgUgylM-z1rT398D8),309
The Tale of Peter Rabbit,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were— Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.
They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.
'Now my dears,' said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, 'you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.'
'Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.'
Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the woods to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries:
But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!
First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;
And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.
But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!
Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'Stop thief!'
Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.
After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have gotten away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.

Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.
Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.
And rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.
Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.
Presently Peter sneezed—'Kertyschoo!' Mr. McGregor was after him in no time.
And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.
Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp while sitting in that can.
After a time he began to wander about, going lippity—lippity—not very fast, and looking all round.
He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.
An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the woods. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.
Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.
He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe—scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!
Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.
Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.
Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.
Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.
He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!
I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.
His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!
'One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'

The Angel's Whisper,3,Poem,"A baby was sleeping;
Its mother was weeping;
For her husband was far on the wild raging sea;
And the tempest was swelling
Round the fisherman's dwelling,
And she cried, ""Dermot, darling, Oh, come back to me!""

Her beads while she numbered
The baby still slumbered,
And smiled in her face as she bended her knee.
""Oh, blest be that warning,
Thy sweet sleep adorning,
For I know that the angels are whispering to thee!

""And while they are keeping
Bright watch o'er thy sleeping,
Oh, pray to them softly, my baby, with me!
And say thou would'st rather
They'd watch o'er thy father,
For I know that the angels are whispering to thee.""

Jack and Jill,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, there were two friends named Jack and Jill. Jack was dumb and couldn't speak or understand any language. Jill, on the other hand, was deaf and couldn't hear anything. Despite their disabilities, they were the best of friends and always found a way to communicate with each other.

One day, they were out in the woods looking for berries to eat. They were having a great time until they got lost. They wandered around for hours trying to find their way back home. But with no way to speak or hear, they were struggling to find a way out.

As the sun started to set, they came across a cave. They decided to take shelter there for the night. Inside, they found a small stream and some wild fruits growing on the cave walls. They were relieved to have found something to eat and drink.

The next day, they woke up early and continued their search for a way back home. They came across a ranger who was out on a hike. The ranger noticed that they were lost and offered to help them. But with Jack unable to speak and Jill unable to hear, the ranger had a hard time understanding their situation.

The ranger then noticed that Jack was able to understand sign language. He quickly used it to communicate with Jill and found out that they were lost. He then showed them the way back home using sign language.

Jack and Jill were overjoyed to be back home safe and sound. They were grateful for the ranger's help and for the fact that they were able to find a way to communicate despite their disabilities. From then on, they always remembered to bring a pen and paper with them on their adventures.

Their friendship continued to grow stronger, and they lived happily ever after. They never let their disabilities stop them from enjoying life and always found a way to communicate with each other.",Jack and Jill (1).png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/ur3tD8kBsI3k4L8xojobKg/B7xe6HMAiSPWyANdzDA2zw_c-GLa_DwWtI92jV2IEaNrX6Hj1j49557vRkEv4LkB93_TLrCfH7kcZEK73iNzDPGm1B7f3NAX3UB2NY_VVjw/u7xdsR9Zuq4jEeYn1sj9aXkzE0Uj-_OvC0dx8DS1qJE),313
Greek and Latin Words,3,Poem,"Greek and Latin words, oh so wise

From myths and tales of long ago
To scientific terms that we know.

And ""natura"" means the natural kind.

Greek gods and goddesses we hear
Zeus, Hera, Athena, oh so dear.
In Latin, ""deus"" means god above
And ""rex"" means king, with power and love.

In science, Greek and Latin thrive
""Anatomy"" from Greek, the body alive.
""Specie"" from Latin, a kind of plant or beast

Trickery of a Fox,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a clever fox called Reynard. Reynard was known for his wit and cunning, and he always found a way to outsmart the other animals in the village. But one day, Reynard met his match when he came across a clever old owl named Athena.

Reynard had heard that Athena had a large collection of delicious and juicy fruits in her tree hollow. Reynard decided he would like to try and steal some of those fruits for himself. He came up with a clever plan to trick Athena and sneak into her tree hollow while she was away.

One day, Reynard approached Athena and said, ""Athena, I have heard that you are the wisest animal in the village. I would like to learn from you, and I would like to know what you think is the best way to protect my own fruits.""

Athena, who was always willing to share her wisdom, told Reynard that the best way to protect his fruits was to be honest, fair, and kind to others. ""If you are honest and fair with others, they will be honest and fair with you in return,"" Athena said.

Reynard pretended to take Athena's advice to heart and thanked her for her wise words. But as soon as Athena was out of sight, Reynard sneaked into her tree hollow and began to eat her fruits.

But Reynard's plan was foiled, as Athena had set a trap for him. Reynard was caught red-handed, and all the other animals of the village heard of his trickery. Reynard was ashamed of his actions and realized the error of his ways.

From that day on, Reynard lived by Athena's teachings and became an honest and fair animal. He learned that honesty and fairness were the keys to a happy and peaceful life, and that stealing and trickery would only bring him shame and regret.

The moral of the story is: Honesty is the best policy, being fair and kind to others will bring you more rewards than trickery and stealing.",Trickery of a Fox.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/xWqq1icIe7ezAwv3tBGdtQ/MH-4MEu1_SUoG1_9K97gTCfiADKJvf-8axxErS6V6qTFPvA9ruzkxaeR9dl41glDrBsyApwUnApUPuk6IxZk32mqNbVZPUh042N8uxvklMI/Oje9Z9JCmltdV-n-_Wmhvmpy3c09db34JjlX6WgDetU),316
The Blind Men and the Elephant,3,Poem,"It was six men of Indostan,
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind.

The First approached the Elephant
And, happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
""God bless me! but the Elephant
Is very like a wall!""

The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried: ""Ho! what have we here,
So very round, and smooth, and sharp?
To me 'tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear!""

The Third approached the animal
And, happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a snake!""

The Fourth reached out his eager hand,
And felt about the knee.
""What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,"" quoth he;
""Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree.""

The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: ""E'en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can:
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan!""

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a rope!""

Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,

The Perfect Pet,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Emily who had always dreamed of having the perfect pet. She spent her days daydreaming about what her perfect pet would be like, imagining all the different animals she could have as a companion.

One day, while walking home from school, Emily passed by a pet store and decided to go inside. As she walked through the aisles, she saw all kinds of animals - dogs, cats, birds, and even a snake. But none of them seemed quite right.

Just as she was about to leave, Emily spotted a small, fluffy creature in the corner of the store. It was a little ball of fur with big, round eyes and a wagging tail. ""What is that?"" she asked the storekeeper.

""That's a hamster,"" the storekeeper replied. ""They're very popular pets because they're easy to take care of and make great companions.""

Emily was immediately smitten. She had never considered getting a hamster before, but this one was just perfect. It was small, friendly, and low maintenance. She knew right away that it was the pet she had always dreamed of.

She named her new hamster ""Fluffy"" and brought him home. Emily took great care of Fluffy, making sure he had a spacious cage, plenty of food and water, and lots of toys to play with. She even built him a little playground in her room where he could run and play.

As the days went by, Fluffy and Emily became the best of friends. They would play together every day, and Emily loved to watch as Fluffy explored his playground and discovered new things. Fluffy loved to cuddle with her as she read her favorite books and listened to music.

Emily couldn't believe how much joy Fluffy brought into her life. He was the perfect pet - always there to cheer her up, make her laugh, and keep her company. She knew that she would always cherish their friendship and be grateful for the day she found the perfect pet in that pet store.

Creating worlds both fair and grim,
In language that will forever please.

To the sweet musings of young love.

So rich and complex, so true,
From Hamlet's musings on mortality,
To Othello's jealousy, so blue.

His words still resonate today,
In speeches, films and songs,
For his legacy lives on and on,
As we marvel at his poetic throngs.

Peter Rabbit Plans a Journey,3,Short Story ,"It's a long jump that makes no landing. —Peter Rabbit.
“The trouble with me is that I'm lonesome,” repeated Peter Rabbit as he sat in the dear Old Briar-patch. “Yes, Sir, that's the only thing that's wrong with me. I'm just tired of myself, and that's why I've lost my appetite. And now I know what's the matter, what am I going to do about it? If I were sure, absolutely sure, that Old Man Coyote meant what he said about our being friends, I'd start out this very minute to call on all my old friends. My, my, my, it seems an age since I visited the Smiling Pool and saw Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter! Mr. Coyote sounded as if he really meant to leave me alone, but, but—well, perhaps he did mean it when he saw me sitting here safe among the brambles, but if I should meet him out in the open, he might change his mind and—oh, dear, his teeth are terrible long and sharp!”
Peter sat a little longer, thinking and thinking. Then a bright idea popped into his head. He kicked up his heels.
“I'll do it,” he said. “I'll make a journey! That's what I'll do! I'll make a journey and see the Great World.
    “By staying here and sitting still
     I'm sure I'll simply grow quite ill.
     A change of scene is what I need
     To be free from all my troubles.”
Of course if Peter had really stopped to think the matter over thoroughly he would have known that running away from one kind of trouble is almost sure to lead to other troubles. But Peter is one of those who does his thinking afterward. Peter is what is called impulsive. 
That is, he does things and then thinks about them later, and often wishes he hadn't done them. So now the minute the idea of making a journey popped into his head, he made up his mind that he would do it, and that was all there was to it. 
You see, Peter never looks ahead. If he could get rid of the trouble that bothered him now, which, you know, was nothing but lonesomeness, he wouldn't worry about the troubles he might get into later.
Now the minute Peter made up his mind to make a journey, he began to feel better. His lost appetite returned, and the first thing he did was to eat a good meal of sweet clover.
“Let me see,” said he, as he filled his big stomach, “I believe I'll visit the Old Pasture. It's a long way off and I've never been there, but I've heard Sammy Jay say that it's a very wonderful place, and I don't believe it is any more dangerous than the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, now that Old Man Coyote and Reddy and Granny Fox are all living here. I'll start tonight when I am sure that Old Man Coyote is nowhere around, and I won't tell a soul where I am going.”
So Peter settled himself and tried to sleep the long day away, but his mind was so full of the long journey he was going to make that he couldn't sleep much, and when he did have a nap, he dreamed of wonderful sights and adventures out in the Great World.
At last he saw jolly, round, red Mr. Sun drop down to his bed behind the Purple Hills. Old Mother West Wind came hurrying back from her day's work and gathered her children, the Merry Little Breezes, into her big bag, and then she, too, started for her home behind the Purple Hills. A little star came out and winked at Peter, and then way over on the edge of the Green Forest he heard Old Man Coyote laugh. Peter grinned. That was what he had been waiting for, since it meant that Old Man Coyote was so far away that there was nothing to fear from him.
Peter hopped out from the dear, safe Old Briar-patch, looked this way and that way, and then, with his heart in his mouth, started towards the Old Pasture as fast as he could go, lipperty—lipperty—lip.",Peter Rabbit Plans a Journey.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/qSLWi073xmv9sNgwgJ0_3g/s6mnOs8l11o-EOt4MXjfr5LPDSrFgwUxE49ujV6w-mwHUw-L_0BsRcqZB2wISIf9Je_q7FoWYoNlmnlN-tzK17RBi-8KpgPlr6vbVpcIGL6biqdS6ir_3g9RRqi7Gvh-/hVPdeDUUJGXVuwXAenIz-fzov78oiRalV-SQzyA8ykI),322
The Spider and the Fly,3,Poem,"The spider spins her web with care,
In corners dark and damp and bare.
She waits with patient, silent grace,
For flies to come and meet their fate.

The fly, so carefree and so gay,
Flits here and there without a care.
But little does she know or suspect,
The danger that she will encounter next.

The spider's web is strong and fine,
A trap for flies that's hard to decline.
The fly, so curious and bold,
Is caught in the web, her fate now told.

The spider creeps up with silent tread,
And wraps the fly in silken thread.
The fly, now trapped and unable to flee,
Is doomed to a fate most disagree.

But as the spider draws her near,
To suck the life from her prey so dear,
The fly, with one last desperate plea,
Whispers ""Why must it be this way?
Can't we just let each other be?""

The spider, with a heart of stone,
Replies ""It's the way of the world, my own.
I must eat to live, as must we all,
And you, my dear, have made the fall.""

And so the fly is doomed to die,
A victim of the spider's sly.
But even in her final hour,
She questions the power of nature's dower.

So let this be a warning true,
To all who fly, or creep, or chew.
Be wary of the traps that life may set,
And learn from the spider and the fly's regret.",The Spider and the Fly.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/4Sgu8igh3SK9wvofrN_wPw/vCkvAhsLY7fOkqbEN73Zop7S62uS2RFVege1Ju69oFJabKtLHs5DzZiS3KJ38Rl9M5JhNwB2MC-dfvhZPLsYIU3lfUiQxSQxp0S3erzAPnk/7b1V9t2HW1CKy43shhmyS2StcQKRg-gi888zwNISlvk),323
Fish,3,Informative Text,"Fish are a diverse group of aquatic animals that have evolved to adapt to various aquatic environments. They can be found in freshwater, saltwater, and even brackish environments. Fish have been around for over 500 million years and are considered to be one of the first animals to have evolved with the ability to swim.

Fish come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colors. Some are small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, while others can grow to be over 100 feet long. Some fish are brightly colored, while others are dull and blend in with their surroundings. Fish also have a wide range of feeding habits, from herbivores to carnivores.

Fish have a number of unique adaptations that allow them to survive in their aquatic environments. They have a streamlined body shape that helps them swim efficiently and scales that provide protection from predators and parasites. Fish also have fins that help them swim and maneuver in water, as well as gills that allow them to extract oxygen from water.

Fish play an important role in the ecosystem, both as a food source for other animals and as a source of oxygen for aquatic plants. Many species of fish are also important to human economies, as they are caught and consumed as food or used in aquaculture.

There are many different types of fish, including bony fish, cartilaginous fish, and jawless fish. Bony fish are the most common type of fish and include species such as salmon, bass, and tilapia. Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks and rays, have a skeleton made of cartilage instead of bone. Jawless fish, such as lampreys and hagfish, do not have jaws and instead have a sucker-like mouth.

Fish can be found in every corner of the world's oceans, from the depths of the abyss to the shallowest coral reefs. They can also be found in freshwater, from small streams to large rivers and lakes. Many species of fish are also kept in aquariums and ponds as pets.

However, overfishing, pollution, and habitat loss are major threats to fish populations worldwide. It is important to take steps to protect and conserve fish populations to ensure that they continue to play their important role in the ecosystem and in human economies.

In conclusion, fish are a diverse group of aquatic animals that have evolved to adapt to various aquatic environments. They play an important role in the ecosystem and in human economies. They come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colors and have unique adaptations that allow them to survive in their aquatic environments. However, it is important to take steps to protect and conserve fish populations to ensure that they continue to thrive in the future.",Fish.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/J2SkiQF60g1rAMoMWHdAWg/Iu176arX-V71GN3dCmSsefve5QF-TjMKqmz_36TXV3RLj8yxKFLnXLU3O_X1vAmc3A6iZQAEimmy5caC6l1xsA/_9WZjvph6N1sxRrMN9SODTQb0HIcVzSslLERiR1vxMY),324
The Magical Baby,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there was a baby born with magical powers. Her parents were overjoyed at her arrival, but they were also worried about how they would protect her from those who would seek to use her powers for their own gain. They decided to keep her abilities a secret and raise her as a normal child.

As the baby grew, it became clear that she was no ordinary child. She could make flowers bloom with a wave of her hand and make the sun shine brighter with a smile. Her parents were amazed and frightened by her powers. They knew they had to keep her abilities hidden, but it was becoming increasingly difficult as she grew older.

One day, a powerful sorcerer learned of the baby's abilities and came to the kingdom to claim her for his own. The parents knew they couldn't keep her powers a secret any longer and had to protect her. They sent her away to a distant land, where she would be safe from the sorcerer's grasp.

The baby grew into a young girl, and she was trained by a wise old wizard to control and use her powers for good. She learned how to fly on the back of a dragon and how to summon rain to water the crops. She became known as the ""Magical Princess"" and was loved and respected by all who knew her.

Years passed, and the sorcerer who had once sought to claim the princess's powers for himself, heard of her kindness and her use of her power for good. He was filled with regret for his past actions and begged for her forgiveness. The princess, being of a kind and forgiving nature, forgave him and even took him as her advisor.

Together, the magical princess and the reformed sorcerer worked to bring peace and prosperity to the kingdom. They used the princess's powers to heal the sick, end droughts, and bring abundance to the land. They ruled justly and were loved by all.

The princess and sorcerer ruled for many years, and when the princess grew old and knew her time was coming to an end, she passed on her powers to her own child, continuing the legacy of a magical ruler who used their powers for good.

The Prince and the Golden Apple,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a beautiful kingdom, there was a young prince named Albert. Albert was born into a royal family and had everything he could ever want. But as he grew older, he began to crave more and more. He wanted the finest clothes, the most luxurious palace, and the most expensive jewels.

One day, a traveler came to the kingdom and told Albert about a magical golden apple that grew in a far-off land. The traveler said that whoever ate the golden apple would become the wealthiest and most powerful person in the world. Albert became obsessed with the idea of getting his hands on the golden apple.

So, he gathered a group of brave knights and set off on a journey to find the golden apple. On the way, they met a poor farmer who told them about the dangers of greed. The farmer said, ""Money and power are fleeting, they will never bring true happiness."" But Albert didn't listen, he was determined to find the golden apple.

After many months of traveling, Albert and his knights finally found the golden apple. Albert was overjoyed, he took a bite and felt a surge of power and wealth. But as he looked around, he saw that his knights were all gone. They had left him, because they realized that Albert's greed had consumed him.

Albert was now alone, with all the wealth and power he had ever wanted, but he was also empty inside. He realized that the farmer was right, true happiness cannot be bought with money or power.

Albert decided to return home and make amends with his family and friends. He gave away all his wealth and power to help the poor and needy. He learned that true happiness comes from giving, not taking.

The Sea,3,Poem,"The Sea is a good friend of mine;
For when I come along,
She makes her ripples dance for glee
And sings a splendid song.
Down close beside her I can watch
The silver sails unfurl,
And every rolling, tumbling wave
Upon the shore uncurl;—
They make wide mirrors for the sky
And zig-zag ropes of sand,
To mark the farthest edges where
The water touches land.

At night the Moon a pathway makes
Across the spreading Sea;
It must be for the Sea's mermaids
And small mermen, and me.
It leads straight from its skyward end
To ripples at my feet,
And sometime I perchance may trip
Along the golden street;

And walk the Milky Way

The Stellar One,3,Short Story ,"When the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. 
One of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest.  She was unlike any that came before her. 
She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. 
Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. 
As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. 
She would wonder what it would be like to go to them. Week after week and month after month she would wonder. Until one day she decided to go find out. 
The rock had never gone anywhere before and wasn't sure how to go about it. 
She started to rock back and forth.
Then she started to spin. 
Soon enough, she was flying through the sky. 
As she left, clouds swirled on the big blue planet. For it was sad to see her go, and when planets cry there is a rain storm. 
At first the rock was not good at moving. She would spin too far to the right or too far to the left. Slowly she learned how to travel whichever direction she liked, and she enjoyed exploring space. 
She saw a planet filled with water, with not a speck of land.
Then found a planet all dried up, with beaches made of sand.
She swore she met a planet who looked suspiciously like her.
And then she saw a planet that was, well… she wasn’t sure. 
One planet she discovered, had grown forests made of green.
Another one was very shy, not fond of being seen.
She flew right by a planet, that was frozen icy cold.
And then she saw a planet that was made of jewels and gold!
She had started to notice that each planet seemed brighter than the last. 
They were all so different and all so pretty. 
It became hard for her to decide where to go next. If each planet she visited was more beautiful than the one before it, then how could she decide which way to go next, and how could she decide where to stay. 
So she continued traveling, afraid to miss a single planet. 
Eventually she came upon the big blue planet that she had once circled, but she found that is was not the same. It was shining in a way that it never had before. It was more blue than it had ever been, and certainly more beautiful. 
This made her stop for a moment. 
“I do not know where I should go next” she said out loud. “Each direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.”
The big blue planet overheard this. “Can you not see why I am brighter?"" it asked.
""You are the brightest planet I have ever seen,"" she said, ""but I do not know why you glow brighter today than you did when I left you.""
“You have brightened me,” it said. 
“But I am just a rock” she replied. 
“You are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,” said the big blue planet. “You have grown bold and bright. Now you are a shooting star, and you are the reason that I shine.  And while you are worrying about which direction to go, all of the planets in space are hoping that you will come their way to brighten them.”
And so the shooting star, who was no longer just a rock, finally understood. It did not matter where she went, the light was her own. 
So the rock sat there for a moment, by the bright blue planet and wondered. 
 ""Should I keep traveling, or should I fly around the big blue planet and grow brighter with it each day.”
She thought, until she knew exactly what to do. ",The Stellar One .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/soqtbmX9JghlXWCZKZ5hig/oZ665RyCIGL2GOZkFHxSM0RNgw1z3PNmivnKlbC--o8Bujz2vmhCHdVghCqIyV1QVpB6rf42CAiU8YBEV5IFU-YyuC85PlrRDxUC5MQusMI/JtfGPJgBHiWh6wamoTEKVk06t_AhIXOsRjO3nrOcI6c),331
Couch Potato,3,Poem,"Oh couch potato, how you lay
In your lazy, idle state.
On cushions soft, and springs that sway
You watch the hours dissipate.

With remote in hand, you flip and scroll
Through endless channels on the screen,
Your mind numb, your body whole
A vegetable, a human being.

But oh, how sweet the life you lead
No stress, no rush, no care at all.
You sit and vegetate, indeed
A master of leisure, standing tall.

Though some may scoff and criticize
Your lazy ways, your idle time.
You know the secret, deep inside
That true contentment is not a climb.

So let them scoff, let them deride
For you, dear couch potato, know,
That true happiness is not a ride
But simply sitting, letting go.

The Life Cycle of Butterflies,3,Informative Text,"A butterfly starts its life as a small, round egg. The egg is laid by a female butterfly on a leaf or stem of a plant. After a few days, the egg hatches and a tiny caterpillar comes out.

The caterpillar is the next stage in the butterfly's life cycle. It eats and grows bigger and bigger. As it grows, it molts, or sheds its skin, several times. After a few weeks, the caterpillar has grown so much that it is ready to turn into a butterfly.

The caterpillar attaches itself to a leaf or stem and forms a hard shell around itself. Inside this shell, the caterpillar's body changes and transforms into a butterfly. This process is called metamorphosis.

After a few days, the butterfly emerges from its shell. Its wings are small and wrinkled, but they will soon expand and dry out. The butterfly pumps blood into its wings to help them dry and harden. Once the wings are dry and strong, the butterfly is ready to fly.

The butterfly is now an adult and its life is devoted to finding a mate and laying eggs. This completes the cycle, and the process begins again.

The transformation from egg to caterpillar to butterfly is a remarkable process. It is a reminder of the beauty and wonder of nature.",The Life Cycle of Butterflies.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/TJ4VJVwjq2Ayr8Qtfdr4pw/30evS3zqHeFkhQYTLcEbpyizDZ2-GWMZ7ldpKuvu6EEG3_lvFu5HT8dmC9QzbVwFiXJPiD1vR_6k2hUC7vV9sBu_7L1Q2ubEOIRlObDWVN0tQBdhmjLFFXlmN6LH2hFU/64NtYQrDzeYm-gYw-2seRdMMVlbDPbMoo5XXKp9EWvE),335
The Story of Yes and No,3,Short Story ,"Before words were words, a boy named Yes lived in a small village in a small kingdom. Yes was good at everything. He was the best, smartest and most liked person in his village. 
Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself. Whenever the villagers asked No for help, he refused because he didn’t like people very much.  Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would gladly help, and he secretly didn’t mind the fact that it irritated No when he did.
One day Yes and No’s father, Okay went on a long journey and he left his two sons in charge of all the animals. Yes took good care of the great guck, and the icks, and the three-toed yock. [Keep in mind, my dear friend, that the guck, ick, and three-toed yock were very old animals, so you might know them by different names today.] No didn’t want to be bothered with the boring tasks involved with taking care of the animals. So instead of helping his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water. 
A few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot about the yock.
It just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often.  So often, that when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King’s carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it.  The King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt himself.
The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an explanation. Yes was always honest, so he told the King the entire story.
The King thought for a moment, and then he came up with an idea that he was quite happy with. Yes and No were to work in the castle as his personal assistants as punishment for what was later referred to as the worst three-toed yock and carriage accident in the Kingdom’s history.
The King needed help with many things around the castle because a King cannot be bothered with the daily tasks involved with running a Kingdom.  However, soon after his decision about the two brothers, the King realized that only Yes would be of any use to him as a servant.  Whenever the King asked No to bring him anything, it would get thrown away, broken, or eaten, without exception. The King was quite sure that No was the worst servant in the entire world. 
The brothers’ most important task was to help pick the food for a grand party that the King was throwing later that night. Cooks from all over the Kingdom lined up at the castle’s gate to offer the King their food for the party.  Of course, the King could not go and grab the food himself, so he asked Yes and No to do it for him.
The first cook came up the gate and yelled to the Gatekeeper, “I bring my delicious ugberry pie for the King’s banquet!”  The King heard this and thought that ugberry pie would be perfect for such an event (and he would love to eat the leftovers). He didn’t want anything to happen to the ugberry pie, so he yelled “Yes!” and then asked him to go fetch it.
The next cook stepped up to the gate. “I offer the King grukie soup!” he said.
The King didn’t like grukie soup very much and he knew just how to get rid of it.
“No!” he yelled and then sent No out to retrieve the soup. No dropped the soup before the King could even smell it.
This went on for hours. If the king liked a dish, he would yell “Yes!” and it would be included in the night’s feast. If he did not, everyone would hear a loud “NO!” and the dish would be destroyed moments later by a servant with a very bad attitude.
Pretty soon this started catching on around the Kingdom, for if a King does something, his loyal subjects are never far behind.  If they didn’t want a second scoop of potatoes, they would say “No.” And if they liked what someone was offering, they would say, “Yes.” And ever since that day in a small village in a small kingdom, Yes has meant Yes, and No has meant No. 
This small kingdom also happens to be the birthplace of Yes and No’s cousins, Please and Thanks, but that is another story for another time…",The Story of Yes and No .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/eiLfBD0Fm9-SF4x-TF7brg/0WhyrUA-nezvA6gN0LnXv_bAY0sGON1HN3zfKyj2AMZQNYOHiuwYIx9WaOD4bRZ_QUwxnqnvH7OjKiR-BLMnxai-WKlJWuRN57UDtu87DeY/lrbu_eXX1BokS9efw1kWIfjE0xRvhh9Bm-1xQ6Jccok),336

Love for Animals,3,Poem,"Love for animals, a passion so pure

In the flutter of a butterfly, we see a dance,

We see a reflection of the skies.

Relationship Between Verb and Tense,3,Informative Text,"Verbs are words that describe an action or a state of being. They are an essential part of a sentence because they tell us what the subject of the sentence is doing or being.
Tense is the grammatical term used to indicate when an action is taking place. 
There are three main tenses in the English language: past, present, and future.
The Past Tense: It is used to describe actions that have already happened. 

- For example, in the sentence ""I walked to the store,"" the verb ""walked"" is in the past tense because it tells us that the action of walking has already occurred. 
- Another example is ""He talked to his friend"" in this sentence the verb ""talked"" is in the past tense because it tells us that the action of talking has already occurred.

The Present Tense: It is used to describe actions that are happening now. 

- For example, in the sentence ""I am walking to the store,"" the verb ""am walking"" is in the present tense because it tells us that the action of walking is happening at the moment of speaking. 
- Another example is ""He is talking to his friend"" in this sentence the verb ""is talking"" is in the present tense because it tells us that the action of talking is happening at the moment of speaking.

The Future Tense: It is used to describe actions that will happen in the future. 

- For example, in the sentence ""I will walk to the store,"" the verb ""will walk"" is in the future tense because it tells us that the action of walking will happen at some point in the future. 
- Another example is ""He will talk to his friend"" . In this sentence the verb ""will talk"" is in the future tense because it tells us that the action of talking will happen at some point in the future.

It's important to note that some verbs are irregular verbs that don't follow the usual pattern of the past, present, and future tenses. For example, the verb ""to be"" is irregular in the present tense, ""I am"" instead of ""I is"", and in the past tense, ""I was"" instead of ""I were"".
In summary, verbs are words that describe an action or state of being and tenses are used to indicate when an action is taking place. There are three main tenses in English: past, present, and future. Understanding the relationship between verbs and tenses is important for forming grammatically correct sentences and effectively communicating your ideas.",Relationship Between Verb and Tense.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/yzFJx0ALydLEKjHL22Wd6A/34GXml-R_pNp-eGOcUkZDYwlTsk9kzmzyCInGjdvh1UJAC1HLPO35DhNJthHrBkgh_dbvy73oy8m7wWgGhCxhm6UNb6jyjkYuA5BZNBZ1xMBjf_InICyp7TaSQBe14p3/4b5cohxQK6HWExz1iFsXg02T5dxUfBzPVltw0upKHjg),339
Deaf and Dumb,3,Poem,"He lies on the grass, looking up to the sky;
Blue butterflies pass like a breath or a sigh,
The shy little hare runs confidingly near,
And wise rabbits stare with inquiry, not fear:
Gay squirrels have found him and made him their choice;
All creatures flock round him, and seem to rejoice.

Wild ladybirds leap on his cheek fresh and fair,
Young partridges creep, nestling under his hair,
Brown honey-bees drop something sweet on his lips,
Rash grasshoppers hop on his round finger-tips,
Birds hover above him with musical call;
All things seem to love him, and he loves them all.

Is nothing afraid of the boy lying there?
Would all nature aid if he wanted its care?
Things timid and wild with soft eagerness come.
Ah, poor little child!—he is deaf—he is dumb.
But what can have brought them? but how can they know?
What instinct has taught them to cherish him so?

Since first he could walk they have served him like this.
His lips could not talk, but they found they could kiss.
They made him a court, and they crowned him a king;
Ah, who could have thought of so lovely a thing?
They found him so pretty, they gave him their hearts,
And some divine pity has taught them their parts!",Deaf and Dumb.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/zydU63MmHOv-R6Nd2D0Obw/7SyqlGG-FigByV8KjRtk7TVO60Sp1OXQAaadzH6RlnqBnbW0nqaTAN5urGSZc0orZR4AKaM55KOKeXCRX4I4rLnYr0izlJUgY52xdZ_-OCE/pW2ALbJZZTaW6n7ULVjSaIKZPU09dV6pNYsiHvTAOyQ),340

Thomas Alva Edison,3,Informative Text,"Thomas Edison was an American inventor and businessman who is considered one of the most influential inventors of all time. He is best known for inventing the practical incandescent light bulb and the phonograph.

Edison was born in 1847 in Ohio and had a curious mind from a young age. He was homeschooled by his mother and taught himself how to read and write. He began selling newspapers on the train at age 12 to earn money for his family.

At the age of 21, Edison moved to New York City to work as a telegrapher. He saved money and began experimenting with electricity in his spare time. He invented the first electronic voting machine, which was used in the United States Congress.

In 1877, Edison began working on inventing a practical incandescent light bulb. He tried over 1,000 different materials before finally finding one that worked, a carbonized bamboo filament. He also developed the first electrical distribution system, which sent electricity from power plants to homes and businesses.

In addition to the light bulb and the phonograph, Edison also invented the motion picture camera, the storage battery, and the mimeograph machine. He had over 1,000 patents in his name, more than any other inventor in history.

Despite facing many setbacks and failures, Edison never gave up on his dreams. He once famously said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""

Edison's inventions have had a profound impact on the world and continue to shape the way we live today. He is an inspiration for anyone who wants to make a difference and never give up on their dreams.",Thomas Alva Edison.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Ss-zWOTSpttHsydkk4q-2Q/jeBllsnAzjPiPBzW7v1zIBBf1dNV2nvx9VRRLIFNY2YvLwLnIargCUMhe7UPMCjuq9jsp5JmpJlJayoc5eMTa2KsBKyoJEwhyuLcv7hvAq8/uccR3zpHXRk_XX1mhcOjnetG8J03TXi3_zqrzC1iX6Y),343

The Land of Counterpain,3,Poem,"When I was sick and lay a‐bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
And all my toys beside me lay
To keep me happy all the day.

And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed‐clothes, through the hills;

And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
All up and down among the sheets;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.

I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow‐hill,
And sees before him, dale and plain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.",The Land of Counterpain.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/N43OTxo3KBXNmUk1KaHOtw/nh6Z8Od-Tvl7Md1H7j4TTe-U5TDOdMgyCXs5W6PTZ0lAtqzoaFlMtebu3uPn7k9HOCHOssmuRq7pft9mD1868HBi7b9cDaUvc2LCUYoHQQg/6mfAewym-UToIYMx4Cy9shLLCESe15t30jk5pQk1ukM),345
Complex Sentence: Definition and Examples,3,Informative Text,"A complex sentence is a sentence that contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete sentence. A dependent clause, on the other hand, cannot stand alone as a complete sentence because it does not express a complete thought.

For example, in the sentence ""I will go to the store after I finish my homework,"" the independent clause is ""I will go to the store"" and the dependent clause is ""after I finish my homework."" The dependent clause ""after I finish my homework"" does not express a complete thought, so it cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. Together, the independent and dependent clauses make a complex sentence.

Another example is ""When the rain stopped, we decided to go outside"" Here the dependent clause ""when the rain stopped"" and independent clause ""we decided to go outside"" together make a complex sentence.

Complex sentences can also include multiple dependent clauses, as in the sentence ""Although it was raining, and the wind was blowing, we still decided to go on a hike."" Here, two dependent clauses ""Although it was raining"" and ""the wind was blowing"" modify the independent clause ""we still decided to go on a hike""

Complex sentences are an important part of the English language because they allow us to express multiple ideas and thoughts in a single sentence. They can also make our writing more interesting and varied.

In summary, a complex sentence is a sentence that contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete sentence. A dependent clause, on the other hand, cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.

Story of a Selfish Giant,3,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a selfish giant who lived in a grand castle on the top of a hill. The giant was very proud of his castle and the beautiful gardens that surrounded it, but he was not a kind or generous giant. He was always thinking of himself and never cared about others.

The giant had a big wall around his castle and gardens, and he never allowed anyone to enter. The children from the village below were not allowed to play in the beautiful gardens and were very sad because of this. They used to play in a small patch of land near their village, but it was not as pretty as the giant's garden.

One day, a little boy from the village climbed over the wall and entered the giant's garden. The giant was furious when he saw the boy and he chased him out of the garden. But the boy left behind a small bird that he had been playing with, and the giant was taken by its beauty. He decided to keep the bird in his garden as a pet.

The giant was so pleased with the bird that he started to change. He began to realize how selfish he had been and how much he had hurt the children from the village. He felt guilty for not letting them play in his garden, and he decided to make amends.

He opened the gates of his garden and invited the children to come and play. The children were overjoyed and they ran into the garden, laughing and playing. The giant watched them with a smile on his face, and he felt happier than he had ever felt before.

The giant also started to tend to his garden, and he planted many beautiful flowers and trees. He even built a playground for the children and a small lake where they could paddle in boats. The giant was no longer selfish, and he became known as the kind giant.

Years passed, and the giant grew old. But he was content because he knew that he had made amends for his past selfishness. The children from the village continued to play in his garden, and they always remembered the kind giant who had changed their lives.",Story of a Selfish Giant.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/RZQSRyBGkK_5PquxuFriyg/iD1As-n0LEOFlgMVvqhmHvweP3pdNsGn_e871bIw7d3eAYCapU10TTx6kWkgVzZ0Q32VDMwn6bHRqzONKUmkL_vNQ8nLoxU3j9LSeuRd4m0/sHT94ucl_LbtfVqUnn43BipSpAQrNhCkEpqcwl94BE4),347

Dialogue,3,Informative Text,"Dialogue is an essential element in storytelling, as it allows characters to express their thoughts, emotions, and actions in a way that brings the story to life. It also creates a sense of realism and helps the reader to understand and connect with the characters. In children's literature, dialogue is often used to convey important messages and lessons, as well as to create a sense of connection between the characters and the reader.
Examples
- One popular children's book that uses dialogue effectively is ""Charlotte's Web"" by E.B. White. In this story, a young girl named Fern befriends a pig named Wilbur and a spider named Charlotte. The dialogue between Fern, Wilbur and Charlotte is heartwarming and helps to convey the themes of friendship and loyalty. For example, when Wilbur is worried that he will be sent to the butcher, Charlotte assures him that she will think of something to save him,

“'Don't worry, Wilbur, I'll think of something,' said Charlotte. 'I'll think of something and you'll see. Things always work out for the best.'”

- Another example of effective dialogue in children's literature is ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" by J.K. Rowling. In this story, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger have a conversation about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The dialogue between Harry, Ron and Hermione is dynamic and helps to convey the excitement and wonder of the magical world. For example, when Harry receives his acceptance letter to Hogwarts, Ron and Hermione are excited for him,

“'Hogwarts!' Ron exclaimed. 'Cool!'
'I've heard of it,' said Hermione. 'It's supposed to be the best wizarding school in the world.'”

- ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" by C.S. Lewis is also an example of a children's book that uses dialogue to great effect. The dialogue between the children and the lion Aslan is powerful and helps to convey the themes of courage and sacrifice. For example, when the children are afraid to enter the witch's castle, Aslan encourages them,
“'Safe?' said Mr. Beaver. 'Don't you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safety? 'Course he isn't safe. But he's good. He's the King, I tell you.'”

In conclusion, dialogue is an important aspect of children's literature, as it allows characters to express themselves and convey important messages. The examples of ""Charlotte's Web"", ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" demonstrate how effective dialogue can be in creating a sense of connection between the characters and the reader, while also conveying important themes and messages.",Dialogue.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/tA1MAeB5PeSZ1h2TuJDN3A/xChHdi7C1d7_-_9aqCp7LCkDEe5zOJpmPaWVCRXAehLZFsRpv-KdI4IPqQWMsxwtK8sx3YtXn1ue0bHPlvOvB96T4uHniOuyC2nvwBTcR7Q/iGzC_puAQHrhc_SgQGCaGFbCo_2YQTCtsAnvBVrmbGg),350
Albert Einstein,4,Informative Text,"Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist and mathematician, who is widely considered one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of relativity and his famous equation, E=mc².
Einstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany. As a child, he had a difficult time in school, struggling with memorization and traditional teaching methods. He was often punished for his lack of attention and was considered a slow learner. Despite these challenges, Einstein had a deep curiosity about the natural world and was fascinated by mathematics and physics.
When Einstein was 15, his family moved to Switzerland, where he attended high school. It was there that he developed a love for mathematics and physics. However, he struggled with the rigid educational system and eventually dropped out of school.
After leaving school, Einstein worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland. During this time, he had a lot of free time and used it to continue his studies and work on his own scientific research. He published his first papers on theoretical physics, which were met with skepticism by the scientific community.
Despite the initial rejection, Einstein persisted in his work and continued to develop his theories. In 1905, he published a series of papers that would change the world of science forever. These papers included his theory of special relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of time and space, and his famous equation, E=mc², which laid the foundation for the development of nuclear energy.
Einstein's work was quickly recognized and he soon became a respected scientist, receiving numerous accolades and awards for his contributions to the field of physics. In 1914, he was appointed as a professor at the University of Berlin, where he continued to work on his theories and conduct research.
Throughout his life, Einstein was an advocate for social justice and peace. He was a vocal critic of the rise of fascism in Europe and spoke out against the persecution of Jews. In 1933, Einstein fled Germany, leaving behind his position at the university and his possessions, he then moved to the United States where he worked as a professor at Princeton University.
Einstein's work and ideas continue to influence science and technology today. His theories of relativity have been proven to be accurate and continue to be used in many areas of science and technology, including GPS and the study of black holes.
In conclusion, Albert Einstein's story is an inspiration to many, despite facing challenges and setbacks in his early life, he never gave up on his passions and curiosity for the natural world. He kept working hard and eventually became one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, his theories continue to shape the modern world and inspire future generations.

The Baby,4,Short Story ,"King Halfdan lived in Norway long ago. One morning his queen said to him:
""I had a strange dream last night. I thought that I stood in the grass before my bower. I pulled a thorn from my dress. As I held it in my fingers, it grew into a tall tree. The trunk was thick and red as blood, but the lower limbs were fair and green, and the highest ones were white. I thought that the branches of this great tree spread so far that they covered all of Norway and even more.""
""A strange dream,"" said King Halfdan. ""Dreams are the messengers of the gods. I wonder what they would tell us,"" and he stroked his beard in thought.
Some time after that a serving-woman came into the feast hall where King Halfdan was. She carried a little white bundle in her arms.
""My lord,"" she said, ""a little son is just born to you.""
""Ha!"" cried the king, and he jumped up from the high seat and hastened forward until he stood before the woman.
""Show him to me!"" he shouted, and there was joy in his voice.
The serving-woman put down her bundle on the ground and turned back the cloth. There was a little naked baby. The king looked at it carefully.
""It is a goodly youngster,"" he said, and smiled. ""Bring Ivar and Thorstein.""
They were captains of the king's soldiers. Soon they came.
""Stand as witnesses,"" Halfdan said.
Then he lifted the baby in his arms, while the old serving-woman brought a silver bowl of water. The king dipped his hand into it and sprinkled the baby, saying:
""I own this baby for my son. He shall be called Harald. My naming gift to him is ten pounds of gold.""
""I own this baby for my son. He shall be called Harald.""
Then the woman carried the baby back to the queen's room.
""My lord owns him for his son,"" she said. ""And no wonder! He is perfect in every limb.""

Different Types of Rocks,4,Informative Text,"Rocks are a natural part of our Earth's surface. They are formed from different materials and can be found in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. There are three main types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of molten rock or magma. They are the most common type of rock and can be found all over the world. They are usually hard and have a crystalline structure. Examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and pumice.
Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and compression of small particles, such as sand, clay, and shells. They are usually softer than igneous rocks and have a layered structure. Examples of sedimentary rocks include limestone, sandstone, and shale.
Metamorphic rocks are formed from the alteration of existing rocks due to heat, pressure, and chemical processes. They are usually harder than sedimentary rocks and have a more complex structure. Examples of metamorphic rocks include slate, marble, and quartzite.
Igneous rocks are classified based on the way they were formed, whether it's extrusive or intrusive. Extrusive igneous rocks are formed from lava that cools quickly on the surface, while intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools slowly beneath the surface.
Sedimentary rocks are classified based on the way they were formed, whether it's clastic, organic or chemical. Clastic sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation of small particles, organic sedimentary rocks are formed from the remains of living organisms, and chemical sedimentary rocks are formed from the precipitation of minerals from water.
Metamorphic rocks can be classified based on the type of parent rock, whether it's igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic. They can also be classified based on the type of metamorphism, whether it's regional or contact. Regional metamorphism occurs when the rock is affected by heat and pressure over a large area, while contact metamorphism occurs when the rock is affected by heat and pressure from nearby igneous intrusions.
In conclusion, rocks are a natural part of our Earth's surface, they are formed from different materials and can be found in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. There are three main types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Each type of rock can be classified based on their formation process and the materials that compose them, each type of rock has its own characteristics and properties, and each one plays an important role in shaping the Earth's surface.",Different Types of Rocks.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/vTLBPfFde7XY42SdQ4q7Sw/wuOIkO2GwFdeEWBKAC1g4sLfYyAXkodEkzp-2in41Vi_xmQ_wWCxO4mC4JIp1zu6Gw74TnYgUux1wXI6Z3oy5B0y2olHw4OAgaZnOM3XsML5z6h29jqajimAgG_5gFOB/q5e49S99K8KE-9n9ViFDfPbcl_gF1f-itWrSwX5twbk),354
A Skilled Skateboarder,4,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the countryside, there lived a young boy named Jack. Jack was an adventurous and curious child who loved to explore the outdoors and try new things. One day, while exploring the nearby woods, he stumbled upon an old and worn skateboard. Intrigued by the strange object, Jack picked it up and brought it home with him.
From that day on, Jack became obsessed with skateboarding. He spent every free moment he had learning how to ride it and perfecting his skills. He practiced on the sidewalks, in the streets, and even in his own backyard. He watched videos and read articles online to learn more about Skateboarding and the different tricks he could do.
As Jack's skills improved, he started to venture out to the local skatepark. The park was filled with older, more experienced Skateboarders who would often mock and tease him for being the new kid. But Jack didn't let their words discourage him. He knew that the only way to improve was to practice and keep trying.
One day, Jack was at the Skatepark when a famous Skateboarder, named Tony Hawk, came to visit. Jack couldn't believe his eyes, he had always looked up to Tony and admired his skills. Tony saw Jack's potential and offered to give him private lessons to help him improve his skills.
Jack eagerly accepted Tony's offer, and they began to train together. Tony taught Jack the proper techniques, the best ways to practice, and how to overcome fear. Jack's skills improved rapidly, and he soon became one of the best Skateboarders at the park.
With Tony's help, Jack entered a local Skateboarding competition and surprised everyone by taking first place. His victory earned him a spot in the regional competition, and then eventually, the national competition. Jack was determined to win, he had worked hard, and he knew it was his chance to prove himself.
The day of the national competition arrived, and Jack was filled with nerves and excitement. He performed his tricks flawlessly, and the judges were impressed. In the end, Jack was declared the winner, and he became a national champion.
Jack's victory was a turning point in his life. He has proven to himself and others that hard work and determination can help you achieve your goals. He also learned that it's important to not give up, even when others doubt you, and that with the help of a mentor, anything is possible.
With his newfound fame, Jack started a Skateboarding school to help other kids learn the sport and follow their dreams, just as he did. He also started a charity that helped underprivileged children to get access to Skateboarding equipment.
Years later, Jack became a professional Skateboarder and traveled the world, performing and competing. He became a role model for many young Skateboarders, who looked up to him as an inspiration. Jack's passion for Skateboarding had not only helped him achieve his dreams but also had a positive impact on many other people's lives.
In conclusion, Jack's story teaches us that with hard work, determination, and the help of a mentor, we can achieve our goals and reach our dreams. It also teaches us that it's important to not give up, even when others doubt you and that passions can shape your future and leave a lasting impact on others.",A Skilled Skateboarder.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/RLJWh_QXh1X2yQgjXoQj8w/Y7QmMhzVigwc9pKOBkgukiOAnt5wH3SNT6wDWhAQJZy4DSof3cMsjizYpuCApmqjlnppzMkO3860AhIRYo5i8cLiJVFu3fOBx1UeLXh0VP8/uIBkWLsNoH7sde13zta7w-SyLV52x-RImXX-SHeBTq4),355
How the Little Kite Learned to Fly,4,Poem,"""I never can do it,"" the little kite said,
As he looked at the others high over his head;
""I know I should fall if I tried to fly.""
""Try,"" said the big kite; ""only try,
Or I fear you never will learn at all.""
But the little kite said, ""I 'm afraid I'll fall.""

The big kite nodded: ""Ah, well, good-by;
I'm off""; and he rose toward the tranquil sky.
Then the little kite's paper stirred at the sight,
And trembling he shook himself free for flight.
First whirling and frightened, then braver grown,
Up, up, he rose through the air alone,
Till the big kite looking down could see
The little one rising steadily.

Then how the little kite thrilled with pride,
As he sailed with the big kite side by side.
While far below, he could see the ground,
And the boys like small spots moving round.
They rested high in the quiet air,
And only the birds and clouds were there.
""Oh, how happy I am,"" the little kite cried;
""And all because I was brave, and tried.""",How the Little Kite Learned to Fly.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/1Xr97e4KExca4UsZ77DBDw/7hVosM6yAod_FH_-3U05Jwjx_S2IhsCgpTi9DMVRkassSk861IShK1WZWRB95_wev2TnskTQzWhJNzSNvzJwoqW2_tFapB2bpyMJ2QhjNT-OFmvlbGglbXrd473IW6Yi/G00QXhsqqozbMOx7ahPZm4OV-HPaCY390IPAztDBsy0),356
Homonyms and Homophones,4,Informative Text,"Homonyms are words that are spelled and pronounced the same, but have different meanings. These words can cause confusion when used in a sentence, as they can have different meanings depending on the context. For example:
- ""Bass"" can mean a type of fish that lives in freshwater or saltwater, or a low frequency sound that can be produced by a musical instrument.
- ""Bear"" can mean an animal that lives in the woods and can be dangerous or to hold or support something.
- ""Sale"" can mean an event where goods are sold at a reduced price or the act of selling something.
Homophones are words that are pronounced the same, but are spelled differently and have different meanings. These words can be easily confused in writing, as they may sound the same but have different meanings. For example:
- ""Flower"" and ""flour"" are homophones. ""Flower"" is a plant that blooms and ""flour"" is a powder made from ground grain.
- ""Brake"" and ""break"" are also homophones. ""Brake"" means to slow down a vehicle and ""break"" means to separate something into pieces.
- ""Their"" and ""there"" are homophones. ""Their"" is possessive and refers to something that belongs to someone, ""there"" is used to indicate a place or a location.
It's important to understand the difference between homonyms and homophones in order to use them correctly in writing and speech. When in doubt, it's always a good idea to double-check the spelling and meaning of a word to make sure you are using it correctly.",Homonyms and Homophones.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/tkjgzywouVxSRcqgAlZTEA/RU1tsm6fwr-tEVZs3rZFSI9Fzg6LhL4UVsLqhsvGX-Y1TOgaqsCCPcAXFC4AmgajrOAtAdDK-2C-jHVwmQYB9uq8M8coNkoSAcxHCMsrv45nnPuhcqN0Qc1BJ-LNyn7N/BtHpZI1nBt_ckxl4YuPAq74W9gBqGpsjjKAg1fK7LPg),357
The Jealous Athlete,4,Short Story ,"Near the statue of Milo of Croton stood that of Theagenes, another noted athlete, who lived many years after Milo. He too had defeated every rival. He was the winner of many prizes, and all envied him his strength and renown.

One of the men in particular, whom he had defeated in the games, was jealous of him, and of the honors which he had won. This man, instead of trying to overcome these wicked feelings, used to steal daily into the temple to view his rival's statue, and mutter threats and curses against it.

In his anger, he also gave the pedestal an angry shake every night, hoping that some harm would befall the statue. One evening, when this jealous man had jostled the image of Theagenes a little more roughly than usual, the heavy marble toppled and fell, crushing him to death beneath its weight.

When the priests came into the temple the next day, and found the man's dead body under the great statue, they were very much surprised. The judges assembled, as was the custom when a crime of any kind had been committed, to decide what had caused his death.

As it was usual in Greece to hold judgment over lifeless as well as over living things, the statue of Theagenes was brought into court, and accused and found guilty of murder.

The judges then said that, as the statue had committed a crime, it deserved to be punished, and so they condemned it to be cast into the sea and drowned. This sentence had scarcely been executed, when a plague broke out in Greece; and when the frightened people consulted an oracle to find out how it could be checked, they learned that it would not cease until the statue of Theagenes had been set up on its pedestal again. 

The superstitious Greeks believed these words, fished the statue up out of the sea, and placed it again in Olympia. As the plague stopped shortly after this, they all felt sure that it was because they had obeyed the oracle, and they ever after looked upon the statue with great awe.",The Jealous Athlete.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/umcJMPzbZs2Q_S2la30d2w/iKqDBjCYpHvison1JEdqyE8mVzvqDU_XHqmlG9EhyZw_PdEKjDXnUeELrs9qWLNMjIvthsDDBP67EwF2swUGizC5z8O3cAG6D2_fiaOcTI0/zdCedHA_acInwEg6WqXDDMdQ4xXvGQ7t9uc6kf_rn_s),358
The Fairy Queen,4,Poem,"Come, follow, follow me,
You fairy elves that be;
Which circle on the green,
Come follow Mab your queen.
Hand in hand let's dance around,
For this place is fairy ground.

When mortals are at rest,
And snoring in their nest,
Unheard and unespied
Through keyholes we do glide;
Over tables, stools and shelves,
We trip it with our fairy elves.

And if the house be foul
With platter, dish or bowl,
Upstairs we nimbly creep,
And find the sluts asleep;
There we pinch their arms and thighs;
None escapes, nor none espies.

But if the house be swept,
And from uncleanness kept,
We praise the household maid,
And duly she is paid;
For we use before we go
To drop a tester in her shoe.

Upon a mushroom's head
Our tablecloth is spread;
A grain of rye or wheat
Is manchet, which we eat;
Pearly drops of dew we drink
In acorn cups filled to the brink.

The grasshopper, gnat and fly,
Serve for our minstrelsy;
Grace said, we dance awhile
And so the time beguile;
And if the moon doth hide her head,
The glowworm lights us home to bed.

On tops of dewy grass
So nimbly do we pass,
The young and tender stalk
Ne'er bends when we do walk;
Yet in the morning may be seen
Where we the night before have been.",The Fairy Queen.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/nkhJv_6GsqVpacctXxPDIw/ZDMCt5TupaqPLlwLurzoQaRWLvFkRUKcDzCUiEQDC_RT4XNcNRrWBGTTfBm9nNEElxy0OgE41P8UPj3qghk_KzXyPIZbxwjk1IKGU2ZYgEY/IDBAacuvZk4WjMvO6mokwIVXLHJ2VusKuL5xkmAT11g),359
How to Write a Paragraph Correctly,4,Informative Text,"The proper construction of paragraphs is also of great importance. The following rules will serve as guides for paragraphing. They should be learned and the pupil should be drilled in their application.

- A sentence which continues the topic of the sentence which precedes it rather than introduces a new topic should never begin a paragraph.

- Each paragraph should possess a single central topic to which all the statements in the paragraph should relate. The introduction of a single statement not so related to the central topic violates the unity.

- A sentence or short passage may be detached from the paragraph to which it properly belongs if the writer wishes particularly to emphasize it.

- For ease in reading, a passage which exceeds three hundred words in length may be broken into two paragraphs, even though no new topic has been developed.

- Any digression from the central topic, or any change in the viewpoint in considering the central topic, demands a new paragraph.

- Coherence in a paragraph requires a natural and logical order of development.

- Smoothness of diction in a paragraph calls for the intelligent use of proper connective words between closely related sentences. A common fault, however, is the incorrect use of such words as and or but between sentences which are not closely related.

- In developing the paragraph, emphasis is secured by a careful consideration of the relative values of the ideas expressed, giving to each idea space proportionate to its importance to the whole. This secures the proper climax.

- The paragraph, like the composition itself, should possess clearness, unity, coherence, and emphasis. It is a group of related sentences developing a central topic. Its length depends upon the length of the composition and upon the number of topics to be discussed.",How to Write a Paragraph Correctly.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/bmSMlqWzP5jpiz9m1S-hrQ/yDReUutvuOTMNYVewzsu8B3nNn8rUcQs72l4ys2Vy3pe3mif0usksMb5OVAr1QnxiI0MOwMBbGbnOgzLBByMRhfNlwrE-8NTXWGAxAE2QWrDqKQxtgEUfXfBysZ3GYB8/f-s84w2Bm7mYsDToWc8rEH_TMBkUyBx1YBlfPYxd5A4),360
Sarah and Her Love for Words,4,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the mountains, there was a young girl named Sarah. She was a bright and curious child who loved to read and learn new words. Her parents were both teachers and instilled in her the love of learning and the importance of education.
Sarah's love for words and spelling led her to participate in the annual spelling bee competition at her school. She had always been a good speller, but she had never won the competition before. This year, however, she was determined to do her best and bring home the trophy.
Sarah spent months preparing for the competition. She studied the spelling rules, practiced her words every day, and read as many books as she could. She also sought the help of her parents and teachers, who provided her with valuable tips and advice.
The day of the spelling bee finally arrived, and Sarah was filled with excitement and nerves. The competition was fierce, with students from all grades participating. Sarah struggled a bit at first, but she kept her focus and determination.
As the competition progressed, the number of contestants dwindled, and soon it was down to just two: Sarah and her arch-rival, Michael. The two had a fierce competition, with each one spelling word after word correctly. The pressure was high, and the stakes were even higher.
Finally, it was down to the last word. The moderator gave the word, ""antidisestablishmentarianism."" Sarah and Michael looked at each other, both knowing that this was the final word and whoever spelled it correctly would win the competition. Michael went first and spelled it correctly, but with a little hesitation. Sarah then stepped up to the microphone, took a deep breath, and spelled the word perfectly. The crowd erupted in cheers, and Sarah was declared the winner of the spelling bee.
Sarah was overjoyed and couldn't believe that she had won. She had worked hard and had never given up, even when the competition was tough. She had proven to herself that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.
The next day, Sarah was celebrated as a hero at school. Her classmates and teachers congratulated her on her victory, and she was presented with the trophy. She also received a scholarship to attend a prestigious university, where she would continue to pursue her love of words and spelling.
The experience of the spelling bee had a profound effect on Sarah. She had learned the importance of hard work, perseverance, and never giving up. She had also learned that true success is not about winning or losing, but about the journey and the lessons learned along the way.
Years later, Sarah became a teacher, just like her parents, and she passed on her love of words and spelling to her students. She taught them the importance of hard work and determination, and she shared her own story of the spelling bee as an inspiration to them. And so, Sarah's legacy lived on, as she had not only won the spelling bee, but also the hearts and minds of many young students.
In conclusion, the story of Sarah's spelling bee adventure teaches us that with hard work, determination, and perseverance, we can achieve our goals and reach our dreams.

The Lark and the Rook,4,Poem,"""Good-night, Sir Rook!"" said a little lark.
""The daylight fades; it will soon be dark;
I've bathed my wings in the sun's last ray;
I've sung my hymn to the parting day;
So now I haste to my quiet nook
In yon dewy meadow—good-night, Sir Rook!""

""Good-night, poor Lark,"" said his titled friend,
With a haughty toss and a distant bend;
""I also go to my rest profound,
But not to sleep on the cold, damp ground.
The fittest place for a bird like me
Is the topmost bough of yon tall pine-tree.

""I opened my eyes at peep of day
And saw you taking your upward way,
Dreaming your fond romantic dreams,
An ugly speck in the sun's bright beams;
Soaring too high to be seen or heard;
And I said to myself: 'What a foolish bird!'

""I trod the park with a princely air,
I filled my crop with the richest fare;
I cawed all day 'mid a lordly crew,
And I made more noise in the world than you!
The sun shone forth on my ebon wing;
I looked and wondered—good-night, poor thing!""

""Good-night, once more,"" said the lark's sweet voice.

But is your slumber more sweet than mine?

Spacewalk Explained in Short,4,Informative Text,"A spacewalk, also known as an extravehicular activity (EVA), is when an astronaut exits a spacecraft and performs tasks in the vacuum of space while wearing a spacesuit. This can include tasks such as repairing or upgrading equipment, conducting scientific experiments, and inspecting the exterior of the spacecraft.

Astronauts go on spacewalks for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is to perform maintenance and repairs on spacecraft and equipment. This can include fixing issues with solar panels, replacing old parts, and installing new equipment. Spacewalks are also used for scientific research, such as collecting samples of space debris and studying the effects of the space environment on materials. Additionally, spacewalks provide valuable experience and training for astronauts, as well as opportunities for international collaboration.

Astronauts go on spacewalks by exiting the airlock of a spacecraft and using jetpacks to maneuver in space. They are connected to the spacecraft by a tether, which provides them with communication and power. The space suit worn by the astronaut provides them with oxygen, temperature regulation, and protection from the harsh environment of space.

Astronauts must take many precautions to stay safe during spacewalks. The space suit provides the necessary protection from the vacuum of space, but it also poses its own risks. The suit must be properly maintained and tested, and the astronaut must be trained to use it safely. In addition, the astronaut must be aware of the potential hazards of working in space, such as the risk of collision with debris or the dangers of micrometeoroids.

Astronauts train for spacewalks through a combination of simulations, physical training, and spacewalk-specific training. In the simulation training, astronauts practice spacewalk tasks in a simulated space environment. Physical training is essential for preparing the astronauts for the physical demands of spacewalking, such as working in a bulky space suit and maneuvering in the weightless environment. Specific spacewalk training includes learning how to use the equipment and tools that will be used during the spacewalk, as well as reviewing emergency procedures.

In summary, a spacewalk is an activity performed by an astronaut outside a spacecraft in the vacuum of space. Astronauts perform spacewalks for many reasons such as maintenance and repair, scientific research and training. They go on spacewalks by exiting the airlock of a spacecraft and use jetpacks to move around. Safety is a top priority during spacewalks and astronauts train extensively through simulations, physical training, and spacewalk-specific training.",Spacewalk Explained in Short.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/BpKtSABAZpfYVuW3WvuBAg/eRzUWK_ExTNWKrhvVxM-9UUedCANu1lHxPOFnjnDV-GPphFhML0xPisQy_olJEEvf6DqNda1qRZPFmCDlXWvRsEBmt8j8SoYFQ-q5Cs-_OIOw7pJ3L1cF8uS5AsmkaZa/LguI24TuI3NdmTNk4d5vlOrwXR5MWY9Mq2gerkjrzUQ),363
The King and Treasure Hunt,4,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a kind and wise king who ruled over his people with fairness and justice. One day, the king received a letter from a distant land, which contained a map leading to a treasure trove of unimaginable wealth and valuable artifacts. The king was intrigued and decided to organize a treasure hunt to find the riches and bring them back to his kingdom.

The king called forth his bravest and most skilled knights, and together they set out on a journey to find the treasure. The map led them through treacherous mountains, deep forests, and scorching deserts. Along the way, the knights encountered many obstacles and challenges, but they persevered, determined to find the treasure.

The first challenge they faced was crossing a treacherous river. The knights had to build a raft and navigate the currents while avoiding the rapids and rocky shoals. The second challenge was to cross a desert, where they had to face the scorching sun and the lack of water. They had to ration their supplies and use the stars and the sun to guide their way.

Finally, after many weeks of travel, the knights reached the location marked on the map. But to their surprise, they found that the treasure was not a pile of gold and jewels, but a hidden library filled with ancient books and scrolls. The king was disappointed that the treasure was not what he had expected, but he soon realized the true value of the library.

The library contained knowledge and wisdom from all over the world, passed down through the ages. The king and his knights spent many months studying the books and scrolls, and they learned many new things. They learned about science, medicine, art, and history, and they realized that knowledge was the true treasure.

The king and his knights returned to the kingdom, and the king shared the knowledge they had gained with his people. He built schools and libraries, and he encouraged everyone to learn and grow. The kingdom flourished, and the people were happy and prosperous.

The king's wisdom and kindness had led them to the true treasure, and the kingdom was forever changed for the better. And the king and his knights were hailed as heroes for their courage, determination, and wisdom. They had not only found the treasure, but they had also found the key to a brighter future for themselves and their people.

In the end, the king and his knights learned that true wealth and success come not from material possessions but from knowledge and wisdom. They also learned that true treasure is not always what it seems, and that sometimes the greatest treasures are hidden in unexpected places.

The story of the treasure hunt serves as a reminder that true wealth and success come not from material possessions, but from knowledge and wisdom. It also serves as a reminder that true treasure is not always what it seems and that sometimes the greatest treasures are hidden in unexpected places. The adventure, the journey, and the challenge of the treasure hunt is what makes it worth the effort.

Comparison of Adjectives,4,Informative Text,"In comparing objects with each other, we may use three different forms of the same adjective.
For example,
Thomas is strong.
William is stronger than Thomas.
Herbert is the strongest of the three.

This inflection of adjectives is called comparison, and the three forms are called degrees of comparison.

The degrees of comparison indicate by their form in what degree of intensity the quality described by the adjective exists.

There are three degrees of comparison,—the positive, the comparative, and the superlative.

- The positive degree is the simplest form of the adjective, and has no special ending. It merely describes the quality, without expressing or suggesting any comparison. Like, Thomas is strong. Thus, the positive degree of the adjective strong is strong.

- The comparative degree of an adjective is formed by adding the termination er to the positive degree. It denotes that the quality exists in the object described in a higher degree than in some other object. For example, William is stronger than Thomas. Thus, the comparative degree of the adjective strong is stronger.

- The superlative degree is formed by adding est to the positive degree. It denotes that the quality exists in the highest degree in the object described. As in, Herbert is the strongest of the three.

Other examples of the comparison of adjectives are:—
Positive Degree
Comparative Degree 
Superlative Degree
Rich
Richer
Richest 
Poor
Poorer
Poorest 
Fast
Faster
Fastest
Firm 
Firmer
Firmest 

Rules of Spelling

- Adjectives ending in silent e drop this letter before the comparative ending er and the superlative ending est. Thus,— wise, wiser, wisest; pure, purer, purest; handsome, handsomer, handsomest.

- Most adjectives ending in y change y to i before the endings er and est. Thus,— silky, silkier, silkiest; glossy, glossier, glossiest; sorry, sorrier, sorriest.

- Adjectives having a short vowel and ending in a single consonant double this before the endings er and est. Thus,— dim, dimmer, dimmest; sad, sadder, saddest; fit, fitter, fittest; big, bigger, biggest; red, redder, reddest; hot, hotter, hottest.

Many adjectives are compared by prefixing the adverbs more and most to the positive degree. Many adjectives of two syllables and most adjectives of three or more syllables are so compared. Thus,— recent, more recent, most recent; terrible, more terrible, most terrible; triumphant, more triumphant, most triumphant; economical, more economical, most economical.

Some adjectives may be compared in either way.
Examples: intense, intenser, intensest; OR intense, more intense, most intense. So also— profound, sublime, unkind.
Note. The adverbs less and least may be used with an adjective, if one wishes to run down the scale of comparison: as,—terrible, less terrible, least terrible. This idiom, however, should not be regarded as comparison of the adjective. “Superlative” means “in the highest degree,” and is not applicable to least terrible, which means “terrible in the lowest degree.”",Comparison of Adjectives.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/hT-nHSvzvAB1KoU0lj9Tdg/eiTI1a9i8N1utW1_CXHYo4uOYBcsURtj7xVpQROdrXErsfkYj-Hz2kOc24HfIbHxIAlS9IItG94hCBJ81FTuYrkgRX3au0u6moXWsEE3wQAsHUBFuSU9qTuRDmD46ILX/UzYXcRz7qHr8JQZwVmKuvwIX79CCKeeOnV-Qd6Nmeqg),366
My Father Meets a Lion,4,Short Story ,"My father waved goodbye to the rhinoceros, who was much too busy to notice, got a drink farther down the brook, and waded back to the trail. He hadn't gone very far when he heard an angry animal roaring, ""Ding blast it! I told you not to go blackberrying yesterday. Won't you ever learn? What will your mother say!""
My father crept along and peered into a small clearing just ahead. A lion was prancing about clawing at his mane, which was all snarled and full of blackberry twigs. The more he clawed the worse it became and the madder he grew and the more he yelled at himself, because it was himself he was yelling at all the time.
My father could see that the trail went through the clearing, so he decided to crawl around the edge in the underbrush and not disturb the lion.
He crawled and crawled, and the yelling grew louder and louder. Just as he was about to reach the trail on the other side the yelling suddenly stopped. My father looked around and saw the lion glaring at him. The lion charged and skidded to a stop a few inches away.
""Who are you?"" the lion yelled at my father.
""My name is Elmer Elevator.""
""Where do you think you're going?""
""I'm going home,"" said my father.
""That's what you think!"" said the lion. ""Ordinarily I'd save you for afternoon tea, but I happen to be upset enough and hungry enough to eat you right now."" And he picked up my father in his front paws to feel how fat he was.
My father said, ""Oh, please, Lion, before you eat me, tell me why you are so particularly upset today.""
""It's my mane,"" said the lion, as he was figuring how many bites a little boy would make. ""You see what a dreadful mess it is, and I don't seem to be able to do anything about it. My mother is coming over on the dragon this afternoon, and if she sees me this way I'm afraid she'll stop my allowance. She can't stand messy manes! But I'm going to eat you now, so it won't make any difference to you.""

""Oh, wait a minute,"" said my father, ""and I'll give you just the things you need to make your mane all tidy and beautiful. I have them here in my pack.""
""You do?"" said the lion. ""Well, give them to me, and perhaps I'll save you for afternoon tea after all,"" and he put my father down on the ground.
My father opened the pack and took out the comb and the brush and the seven hair ribbons of different colors. ""Look,"" he said, ""I'll show you what to do on your forelock, where you can watch me. First you brush a while, and then you comb, and then you brush again until all the twigs and snarls are gone. Then you divide it up in three and braid it like this and tie a ribbon around the end.""
As my father was doing this, the lion watched very carefully and began to look much happier. When my father tied on the ribbon he was all smiles. ""Oh, that's wonderful, really wonderful!"" said the lion. ""Let me have the comb and brush and see if I can do it."" So my father gave him the comb and brush and the lion began busily grooming his mane. As a matter of fact, he was so busy that he didn't even know when my father left.",My Father Meets a Lion.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/JZCuDfQWJyy2gGezB0zgNg/Ac59MStrBqlZwX0creIBABg0V6ZebpUJZdb9WXpqLp6V8D4zsp-6LZuJbAdRYHlz4ysiE_ECUeoNBJ21IxBeztufkwnWnqZ-h4W4Ghlg6L8/Src-QYPt9ApZLX-iooG8Q9MNwsO0YnY0Mq5deIAPujI),367
"Rain, Wind and Snow",4,Poem,"Do you see the dropping rain,
Pitter-patter on the pane?
How it runs along the street!
And it wets our little feet;
But it makes the green grass grow,
And the tiny streamlets flow.

Listen to the wintry blast
Moaning, shrieking, howling past,
Striking with tremendous force
Rocks and forests in its course;
But it blows the windmills strong,
And it sends big ships along.

Watch the pretty snowflakes fall,
Some are large and some are small;
Look, they cover all the ground,
Miles of dazzling white around;
But this covering, I am told,
Keeps the earth from frost and cold.

Ah! and I must work alway,
Life's not meant to spend in play;
Every moment's fleeting fast,
And our day will soon be past;
If our work is truly done,
It will last though ages run.","""Rain, Wind and Snow.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/5sy7Y2D5HrANJhG81K-3ag/4YerAEprL4niYQGItBfX-_VYOH5sozsZjBI5flKg8n75lD2r7-0McnkyKsz0wATkB8lF9cY3_6LDkZS0Q9ZtgpRYNpvoBbUUnC3rk2G4-zI/cX4wAxT78gIKayyN0N7mxeoM2F_p7BRRcz91cR9lSJU)""",368
Why Do Oceans Have Waves?,4,Informative Text,"Oceans have waves for a variety of reasons, but the primary cause is the wind. When wind blows over the surface of the ocean, it creates friction with the water, causing it to move in ripples. These ripples then continue to build, forming the large waves that we see on the ocean's surface.

The size and shape of the waves are determined by several factors, including the strength and direction of the wind, the distance the wind has blown over the water, and the depth of the water. For example, a strong wind blowing over a large distance will create larger and more powerful waves than a weak wind blowing over a short distance. Additionally, the deeper the water, the larger the waves will be as the wind will not be affected by the depth of the water.

Another factor that contributes to the formation of waves is the interaction of the wind with the Earth's rotation. The Coriolis effect, caused by the Earth's rotation, causes the wind to blow at an angle to the direction it is traveling, creating an additional force that can affect the size and direction of the waves.

Waves can also be caused by other natural phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and underwater landslides. These events create disturbances in the ocean floor that can cause ripples to travel through the water, eventually forming waves on the surface.

Waves also play an important role in shaping the coastlines and shaping the underwater topography. As waves approach the shore, their energy is concentrated into a smaller area, causing the water to become deeper. This can lead to the formation of cliffs, bays, and other coastal features. The waves also erode the shoreline, shaping it into different forms like a crescent beach, a straight beach, or a headland bay.

In addition to these physical processes, waves also play a vital role in the ocean's ecosystem. They help to distribute nutrients and oxygen throughout the water, providing a vital source of food and energy for marine life. They also help to mix the water column, bringing deep, cold water to the surface and making it available for marine life to thrive.

In summary, oceans have waves for a variety of reasons, primarily caused by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The size and shape of the waves are determined by factors such as the strength and direction of the wind, the distance the wind has blown over the water, and the depth of the water. Waves also have an impact on shaping the coastlines and on the ocean's ecosystem, they help to distribute nutrients and oxygen throughout the water and play an important role in marine life.",Why Do Oceans Have Waves.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/cFWoCZRoXQMpQbn6xEZ1Pw/UIl7OKSJyPu2kwtLOddODIl2YVss5J9tlgekCax8SoezaUg4rT594tVTOSWHmoJv7XUqVK2GhTHXORUBVJIa_OZOOfE0xFJeTa7VDrhVPz4/tW1Qed61uq_F8fxuFAoDajYRr-f6BLRwphrvERchlc0),369
King Michael,4,Rhyming Story,"“Michael the Marvelous”, king of the land,
Son of the world famous, “Robert the Grand”,

Was enjoying the night that he turned thirty-two,
As the people arrived for the party he threw.

The Princes of Rya and Princess of Gome,
Were guests in the castle, his majesty’s home.

The cake from the baker was seven feet high,
Putting to shame the poor pie-maker’s pie.

The King and the Queen danced a fanciful jig
While Duchess Von Burkenham ate the roast pig.

Not a dry eye was found when the Queen made her toast
The glasses were raised in salute of their host.

But everything stopped when a black cloud appeared,
And from it, a haggard old man slowly neared.

Along by his side walked a golden-beaked duck.
(The cook tried to picture it roasted and plucked).

He donned a blue robe and a toppling hat,
And he hobbled his way up to where the King sat.

“My sire, I ask for your ear, if I may,
To offer a gift to you, on your birthday.

This duck grants a wish, when you ask it aloud.”
And with that, the old man disappeared in his cloud.

With a waddle, a hop, and a medieval QUACK,
The duck sat himself on the mighty King’s lap.

The King felt part silly, but mostly confused.
Though, cancel the party? He simply refused!

The king got more gifts, never peaking inside,
While the duck waited patiently, by the King’s side.

Until, with a laugh, Michael spoke to a friend,
“I wish, how I wish, that this night would not end!”

When you wish for a wish, you must mind every word,
For a magic-wish duck is a powerful bird…

The duck’s magic beak turned from golden to blue.
The wish had been granted, so off the duck flew.

As wishes had been, this was one of the worst.
From that moment on, the poor kingdom was cursed.

With morning came darkness, no warmth and no sun.
The night would not leave, for the damage was done.

Each morning King Michael had hoped to see light.
While the crops withered slowly, in shadow of night.

The King offered rubies and emeralds galore,
To the knight who would bring the old man to his door.

The hunters went forth on a duck-finding quest.
Until both were captured, the king would not rest.
But no one had seen the duck’s gold-colored beak,
And the search for the man went on week after week.

Off in the forest, a small cabin stood.
The old man had built it with amber black wood.

For he was a wizard, named “Sonto the Bad”,
Who’d been banished by Robert, good King Michael’s dad.

By Sonto’s side, sat his duck and a box,
A box with a trio of tri-colored locks.

Inside of the box, Sonto locked up the sun.
And magic, just magic, could make this undone.

Weeks became months, and the sun never shone.
The peasants were angry and started to groan.

Finally, Michael could take it no more.
He would go fix things and settle this score!

So rarely did Kings travel solo by horse,
But Michael charged on, and he stayed on his course.

The council had urged him that east would be best,
But the King disagreed, and rode off to the west.

The road was not safe, filled with perilous foes,
Like armies of warthogs and red forest trolls.

He battled these creatures without any fear,
In brave, kingly ways that are not mentioned here.

One evening the King paused to look at his map,
And somehow, instead, he slipped into a nap.

He slept rather soundly on leaf-covered ground,
And awoke from his dream when he heard a loud sound.

When he looked round a tree, Michael spotted the source.
“A cabin!” he whispered, and tied up his horse.

Up to the window, he creeped and he crept.
When he saw the old wizard, he cheered and he lept!

“I found you!” he shouted, and burst through the door.
(Though a king should know better than manners so poor).

He insisted the wizard reverse what he’d done,
Then he took back his wish and demanded the sun.

“I’d rather eat wormtoads than do what you say,
But I offer you this, a small game we can play.

Inside of this box lies the magic you seek.”
Sonto grinned wide and continued to speak.

“Three keys for three locks, are the only way in.
Answer three riddles, unlock them and win.

But if you should fail, or not answer in time,
Your title is forfeit, your kingdom is mine!”

A king must be wise to rule over a nation,
So, Michael was ready, without hesitation.

They both took a seat, and the duck gave a glare.
(The King, without knowing, had taken his chair).
The box was between them, it sat in the middle.
Sonto spoke first, to recite the first riddle.

 “I climb up a hill and reach out to the sky,
And still you are taller- I ask, who am I?”

“An ant,” said the king, as the old wizard frowned
“Whose hill only sits but an inch off the ground.”

“Sonto the Bad” muttered, “Well…lucky guess.
We’ll see how you handle the riddle up next.”

 “There’s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,
But you won’t feel my weight, when you rest under me”

The King answered back with the promptest reply,
“Enormous and weightless, you must be the sky.”

Sonto was mad, he did not like to lose.
For last of his riddles, he knew which to choose.

The answers to all three riddles can be found in this picture…
The answers to all three riddles can be found in this picture…

“I’m older than all, and although this is true,
Somehow I’ve seen fewer nights than have you.”
 
Sonto laughed out as he watched the King think,
Until the good King gave a smile and wink…

“The riddle is solved, and the game has been won.
You never see night, because you are the sun!”

The box opened up and a small ball of light,
Shot through the ceiling and took off in flight

 It grew as it rose in a wonderful way,
’Til the sun filled the sky and changed night into day!

At the castle the King had a great celebration
With no gifts allowed, only pure jubilation.

The wizard was jailed for his mischievous crime,
But the king let him out after one day of time.

He was ordered to clean by decree of the Queen,
Look after the horses, and mop the floors clean.

When Michael walked by, he was greeted by cheers.
They spoke of his greatness for years upon years.

However, the duck, was not heard from again
The closest they found was an unpleasant hen.

If you see him, this duck, with his colorful beak,
I warn you, be wary, of that which you speak!",King Michael.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/IGuQSzQ8jm6iGWcoBwLz8A/qAYzR2lRaNydfp2Thrg2FRjH2YjeFCMZu6FMr_ZikB_lO7BrJCYsnYy5-m7qYESrDKywmswkc6uDYnU7keIKktWHdYMcYXrYV4idswRNtAY/sKx86HYuiNLFrZdwBSBsfDb647R1_GeSHeBE5DolQIY),370

Types of Whales,4,Informative Text,"There are currently around 90 recognised species of whales, dolphins and porpoises; they are collectively known as ‘cetaceans’ or simply ‘whales’. There are 15 baleen whales, 3 sperm whales, 23 beaked whales, 2 monodontidae (narwhal and beluga), 42 dolphins (including 4 river dolphins) and 7 porpoises.

Cetaceans are broadly divided into two groups, depending on whether they have teeth (odontocetes) or baleen (mysticetes).

Baleen whales, such as the blue whale, are sometimes called the ‘great whales’ due to their overall larger size. There are 15 baleen whales altogether: these whales have baleen plates in their mouths to sift their food - plankton, krill (little shrimps) and small fish - from seawater.

Toothed whales account for all the remaining species of whales, dolphins and porpoises and they all have varying numbers of teeth. Toothed whales eat mainly larger fish, squid, octopus and at times, other marine mammals.

So which cetaceans do we call ‘whales’? It isn’t very scientific but whales include all the baleen whales and the larger toothed whales such as the sperm whale, beluga, narwhal, and the beaked whales.",Types of Whales.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/EGm3ck2NzbQnfJi9JUYfZg/Tqmhwycx4TLlcPjDzAvAVd3fbgMegwR2gggxbCv0-s2y3Dqer62lDsRRpS6WgQMHk7csuyqYd0DaXG2WabI07shi9ifITkFkAmhKjy7B6gw/JByiFrbsdnxx-iAJn-PkHKyJkKPgo6ZYmbMnhAKpu3c),372
The Atrocious Fairy Tale,4,Short Story ,"I must warn you… this book is ATROCIOUS!
The cover has mud all over it, and one of the pages has sprung a leak.
Even some of the order are in the wrong words.
It is the worst of the worst, so don’t say I didn’t warn you…

Our story begins with an atrocious King, 
None of his laws ever made any sense.

“Tuesday?” he laughed, “There is no such day, and I’ll hear no more of it as long as I am king.”
From that day on in the kingdom, Monday was followed by second Monday or first Wednesday.

His daughter was an atrocious Princess. She was not fancy and polite like most princesses, despite the princess lessons she took each day. She never brushed her hair.  She smelled of month- old bananas, and she was very devious. She even set traps throughout this story. 

One day the Princess went missing. 
In her place there was a note that read:
	“I’ve  taken the Princess.
You me catch never will.”

After reading the note twice to understand it, the King commanded the greatest hero in the land to find his daughter.  The greatest hero in the land happened to be an atrocious hero. He was often too frightened to leave his home, and he was also scared by butterflies.

However, he had once defeated two caterpillars and a moth in a single battle, and this made him the greatest of all the heroes in the land. The hero rode to the castle of the meanest villain in the kingdom, but the villain, too was atrocious. He brought flowers to old ladies whenever he could.  And out of the kindness of his heart, he once built a house for someone who needed it.

The hero stormed the gate and charged into the dungeon of the villain’s castle.

“Surrender the Princess!” he yelled while shaking in his armor.
“I don’t have a Princess,” said the villain, “I use this dungeon to bake cookies, but watch your step because there’s a leak down here.”  The hero was more confused than usual.

“If you didn’t take the Princess, then who did?” asked the hero. “We should go ask the dragon what he thinks.”

Mind you, this was an atrocious dragon.  He was known for being tidy and wise, not fierce and ferocious like dragons are supposed to be. He brushed his teeth every night, and when he breathed, there was no fire, just minty freshness. The dragon was very upset when they found him. 

“Someone’s stolen my gold, and they left this note in its place!” he cried.

It read: “Your gold is with the Princess! Mine now is it!”

“This is odd,” said the hero. “Very odd,” said the villain. “Frmph,” said the dragon who always flossed his teeth when he was upset. “Perhaps the Queen knows something.” The Queen was running around the castle when they arrived. She, actually, was not so atrocious.

“My treasures are missing” she cried. “My books and jewels, and my fine silk.”
“Someone has taken them and left this atrocious note.”

It read: “Your treasure is mine! Do not trying to bother find it.”

“Whoever has stolen your treasure has the Princess,” said the hero. “Here are some flowers,” said the villain. “Look!” said the dragon, “there are footprints of dirt on the floor.”

They followed the footprints all the way up to the tallest tower in the tallest part of the castle. When they looked inside they found all the gold, books, jewels, and silk, covered in dirt. And sitting on a throne on top of the pile, was the Princess.

“Why did you steal these things and make us look for you?” asked the Queen.
“I didn’t want to go to my writing lessons!” said the Princess, “Who needs writing?”
“You do,” said the Queen.  The villain, knight, and dragon all nodded in agreement.

The Queen made the Princess return what she had stolen and apologize. From that day on, the King made the Princess go to her lessons six days a week. She was an atrocious student when they began, but she got better each day. It took the dragon hours to brush all the dirt off his coins.

The villain developed a taste for soggy cookies, and he baked them all the time. The hero decided it was finally time to battle a butterfly… and he lost. As for the Queen, she insisted that the entire atrocious tale be written inside of one of her muddy books.

- There are different types of volcanic eruptive events, including: Pyroclastic explosions, which is fast-moving hot gas and volcanic matter, hot ash releases, lava flows, gas emissions, glowing avalanches, when gas and ashes release.
- Volcanic eruptions can also cause secondary events, such as floods, landslides and mudslides, if there is accompanying rain, snow or melting ice. Hot ashes can also start wildfires.
- Volcanic eruptions can impact climate change through emitting volcanic gasses like sulfur dioxide, which causes global cooling, and volcanic carbon dioxide, which has the potential to promote global warming.
- Volcanic eruptions can pose multiple health threats depending on the proximity of the volcano to the community and whether there was any warning.
- Volcanic eruptions can cause: Suffocation, infectious diseases, such as conjunctivitis, acute and chronic respiratory diseases from falling ash and breathing gasses and fumes, burns and traumatic injuries, such as lacerations from falling rock, eye and skin irritations from acid rain.
- Ash and chemicals from the eruption can also generate risk of food and water contamination, and compromise basic services, like water, transportation, communications and health services. 
- Likewise, the accumulation of ash on roofs can cause damage or collapse of buildings, both immediately and after the event.",Impact of Volcanoes.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/_f4Gkf4FcXBQSU3kh6DzKA/JPWv53kS-xUJMPPY1FcPCEKZd_OfiZBrxZFVxJURQquBoQK9Qk6gbiU9uL5zyHNSe_iK6reYlcabF0EOEDv1pVgurjt5ioBNEmeQyoaAZx0/CND00h4n6FiMC9j1T03Tziz1zuyDAkjEpJMy5oW-bO0),375
The Three Brothers,4,Short Story ,"There was once a man who had three sons, and no other possessions beyond the house in which he lived. Now the father loved his three sons equally, so that he could not make up his mind which of them should have the house after his death, because he did not wish to favor any one more than the others. And he did not want to sell the house, because it had belonged to his family for generations; otherwise he could have divided the money equally amongst them. At last an idea struck him, and he said to his sons: ‘You must all go out into the world, and look about you, and each learn a trade, and then, when you return, whoever can produce the best masterpiece shall have the house.’

The sons were quite satisfied. The eldest wished to be a blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master. They appointed a time when they were to return home, and then they all set out.

It so happened that each found a good master, where he learnt all that was necessary for his trade in the best possible way. The blacksmith had to shoe the king’s horses, and thought to himself, ‘Without doubt the house will be yours!’ The barber shaved the best men in the kingdom, and he, too, made sure that the house would be his. The fencing-master received many blows, but he set his teeth, and would not allow himself to be troubled by them, for he thought to himself, ‘If you are afraid of a blow you will never get the house.’

When the appointed time had come the three brothers met once more, and they sat down and discussed the best opportunity of showing off their skill. Just then a hare came running across the field towards them. ‘Look!’ said the barber, ‘here comes something in the nick of time!’ seized basin and soap, made a lather whilst the hare was approaching, and then, as it ran at full tilt, shaved its mustaches, without cutting it or injuring a single hair on its body.

‘I like that very much indeed,’ said the father. ‘Unless the others exert themselves to the utmost, the house will be yours.’

Soon after they saw a man driving a carriage furiously towards them. ‘Now, father, you shall see what I can do!’ said the blacksmith, and he sprang after the carriage, tore off the four shoes of the horse as it was going at the top of its speed, and rode it with four new ones without checking its pace.

‘You are a clever fellow!’ said the father, ‘and know your trade as well as your brother. I really don’t know which of you I shall give the house to.’

Then the third son said, ‘Father, let me also show you something;’ and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword and swung it in cross cuts above his head, so that not a drop fell on him, and the rain fell heavier and heavier, till at last it was coming down like a waterspout, but he swung his sword faster and faster, and kept as dry as if he were under cover.

When the father saw this he was astonished, and said, ‘You have produced the greatest masterpiece: the house is yours.’

Both the other brothers were quite satisfied, and praised him too, and as they were so fond of each other they all three remained at home and plied their trades: and as they were so experienced and skilful they earned a great deal of money. So they lived happily together till they were quite old, and when one was taken ill and died the two others were so deeply grieved that they were also taken ill and died too. And so, because they had all been so clever, and so fond of each other, they were all laid in one grave.",The Three Brothers.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/EYHjc0y0bBu-1pgBLFWzPg/fwk-MHLKitx7H7RmqyANZmbuJUeaczcMnxesdXP03RqWYNfhmgWpabcvGMRhOi0fdEfO3NG__Jk5EaHA8DRSnkGFgeh6TKRobSE_s0Uw0N8/z1hTsIqItwVYTNKoOL9G_v2pkgdQ6QBotvCtihvle48),376
The Chestnut Burr,4,Poem,"A wee little nut lay deep in its nest
Of satin and brown, the softest and best,
And slept and grew while its cradle rocked,
As it hung in the boughs that interlocked.

Now the house was small where the cradle lay,
As it swung in the winds by night and day;
For the thicket of underbrush fenced it round,
This lone little cot by the great sun browned.

This little nut grew, and ere long it found
There was work outside on the soft green ground;
It must do its part so the world might know
It had tried one little seed to sow.

And soon the house that had kept it warm
Was tossed about by the autumn storm,
The stem was cracked, the old house fell,
And the chestnut burr was an empty shell.

But the little nut, as it waiting lay,
Dreamed a wonderful dream one day,
Of how it should break its coat of brown,
And live as a tree, to grow up and down.",The Chestnut Burr.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/bedaWmiCoSPcZ90SNAfyFg/oA0jqSO2NsQRW6AT-D8HrZADUasZX0KHhNh1z5o68T74OpI63uMxbTHAqLvz_cVSigygDS6VdD52zAu5UgMHE2tUJs5336MUEz5KRxyvj6M/QMgZZtT8sQZDaA1RQ-6MIGatenYcrTkGY8YGTAbfaMw),377
Air Pollution,4,Informative Text,"'- Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.
- Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. 
- Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. 
- Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. 
- World Health Organization (WHO) data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.
- From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate.
- Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate matter which result in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, acute and chronic respiratory diseases.  
- Additionally, around 2.4 billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal.
- The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths annually.
- Sources of air pollution are multiple and context specific. The major outdoor pollution sources include residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles, power generation, agriculture/waste incineration, and industry.

How the Dragon Was Tricked,4,Short Story ,"Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons but they did not get on at all well together, for the younger was much handsomer than his elder brother who was very jealous of him. When they grew older, things became worse and worse, and at last one day as they were walking through a wood the elder youth seized hold of the other, tied him to a tree, and went on his way hoping that the boy might starve to death.

However, it happened that an old and humpbacked shepherd passed the tree with his flock, and seeing the prisoner, he stopped and said to him, ‘Tell me, my son, why are you tied to that tree?’

‘Because I was so crooked,’ answered the young man; ‘but it has quite cured me, and now my back is as straight as can be.’

‘I wish you would bind me to a tree,’ exclaimed the shepherd, ‘so that my back would get straight.’

‘With all the pleasure in life,’ replied the youth. ‘If you will loosen these cords I will tie you up with them as firmly as I can.’

This was soon done, and then the young man drove off the sheep, leaving their real shepherd to repent of his folly; and before he had gone very far he met with a horse boy and a driver of oxen, and he persuaded them to turn with him and to seek for adventures.

By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his fame reached the king’s ears, and his majesty was filled with curiosity to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody. So he commanded his guards to capture the young man and bring him before him.

And when the young man stood before the king, the king spoke to him and said, ‘By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other people, you have, in the eye of the law, forfeited your life. But on one condition I will spare you, and that is, if you will bring me the flying horse that belongs to the great dragon. Fail in this, and you shall be hewn in a thousand pieces.’

‘If that is all,’ said the youth, ‘you shall soon have it.’

So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying horse was tethered. He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the bridle, when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could. Now the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable, and at the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse, ‘What is the matter, my treasure? is anything hurting you?’ After waiting a little while the young man tried again to lose the horse, but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise. But when the same thing happened the third time, the dragon lost his temper, and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating. This offended the horse and made him angry, and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head, he made no further fuss, but suffered himself to be led quietly away. Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off, calling over his shoulder, ‘Hi! dragon! dragon! If anyone asks you what has become of your horse, you can say that I have got him!’

But the king said, ‘The flying horse is all very well, but I want something more. You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lie on the bed of the dragon, or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces.’

‘Is that all?’ answered the youth. ‘That is easily done.’

And when night came he went away to the dragon’s house and climbed up onto the roof. Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung, and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up. But the little bells all began to ring, and the dragon woke and said to his wife, ‘Wife, you have pulled off all the bed-clothes!’ and drew the covering towards him, pulling, as he did so, the young man into the room. Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot, ‘To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him, and when I get back we will eat him together.’

So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him. But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him, the prisoner caught her by the legs, threw her to the ground, seized her and speedily cut her throat, just as she had been about to do for him, and put her body in the oven. Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the king.

The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow. ‘That is not enough,’ said his majesty; ‘you must bring me the dragon himself, or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces.’

‘It shall be done,’ answered the youth; ‘but you must give me two years to manage it, for my beard must grow so that he may not know me.’

‘So be it,’ said the king.

And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take the road to the dragon’s house and on the way he met a beggar, whom he persuaded to change clothes with him, and in the beggar’s garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon.

He found his enemy before his house, very busy making a box, and addressed him politely, ‘Good morning, your worship. Have you a morsel of bread?’

‘You must wait,’ replied the dragon, ‘till I have finished my box, and then I will see if I can find one.’

‘What will you do with the box when it is made?’ inquired the beggar.

‘It is for the young man who killed my wife, and stole my flying horse and my bed covering,’ said the dragon.

‘He deserves nothing better,’ answered the beggar, ‘for it was an ill deed. Still that box is too small for him, for he is a big man.’

‘You are wrong,’ said the dragon. ‘The box is large enough even for me.’

‘Well, the rogue is nearly as tall as you,’ replied the beggar, ‘and, of course, if you can get in, he can. But I am sure you would find it a tight fit.’

‘No, there is plenty of room,’ said the dragon, tucking himself carefully inside.

But no sooner was he well in, than the young man clapped on the lid and called out, ‘Now press hard, just to see if he will be able to get out.’

The dragon pressed as hard as he could, but the lid never moved.

‘It is all right,’ he cried; ‘now you can open it.’

But instead of opening it, the young man drove in long nails to make it tighter still; then he took the box on his back and brought it to the king. And when the king heard that the dragon was inside, he was so excited that he would not wait one moment, but broke the lock and lifted the lid just a little way to make sure he was really there. He was very careful not to leave enough space for the dragon to jump out, but unluckily there was just room for his great mouth, and with one snap the king vanished down his wide red jaws. Then the young man married the king’s daughter and ruled over the land, but what he did with the dragon nobody knows.",How the Dragon Was Tricked.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/YTXRdFgvBrwUj3S0ngMDOA/07uvjnBDdwRUninSthqg8PGtNJQi5uPv1IszpukeQLs31Ti7ngzDb1w_UhvBRYubKK_U7KGl8Uz7uDocg1LO6eCDue8nV9rikTebkZwk0EYwgM9VT3BTjgaEhfHumWOO/L8LI2T9uDXePwbezwkhWJuRBzn5QHnzE7xHjh-TUjus),379
The Night Wind,4,Poem,"Have you ever heard the wind go ""Yooooo""?
'Tis a pitiful sound to hear!
It seems to chill you through and through
With a strange and speechless fear.
'T is the voice of the night that broods outside
When folks should be asleep,
And many and many 's the time I 've cried
To the darkness brooding far and wide
Over the land and the deep:
""Whom do you want, O lonely night,
That you wail the long hours through?""
And the night would say in its ghostly way:
""Yoooooooo!
Yoooooooo!
Yoooooooo!""

My mother told me long ago
(When I was a little tad)
That when the night went wailing so,
Somebody had been bad;
And then, when I was snug in bed,
Whither I had been sent,
With blankets pulled up 'round my head,
I'd think of what my mother'd said,
And wonder what boy she meant!
And ""Who's been bad to-day?"" I'd ask
Of the wind that hoarsely blew,
And the voice would say in its meaningful way:
""Yoooooooo!
Yoooooooo!
Yoooooooo!""

That this was true I must allow—
You 'll not believe it, though!
Yes, though I 'm quite a model now,
I was not always so.
And if you doubt what things I say,
Suppose you make the test;
Suppose, when you 've been bad some day
And up to bed are sent away
From mother and the rest—
Suppose you ask, ""Who has been bad?""
And then you 'll hear what 's true;
For the wind will moan in its ruefulest tone:
""Yoooooooo!
Yoooooooo!
Yoooooooo!""",The Night Wind .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/1Pz6oGrAQHciXJGVD5cpjA/TjJM9Jzv5N6h5soXVkTEh1TgAUgWwzs1Y1djZhcaBSBbimymLSlEM8fbp8YHIdBpf76HAgNguR4OewRtiVjBlgTHcToCFlyt__cNLbevKTU/MvvSbda6GNW2cjGKxSSbwYUbxUpa3YAbmd1eRI6PprQ),380
Essentials of the English Language,,Informative Text,"The three essentials of the English language are: Purity, Perspicuity and Precision.

Purity signifies the use of good English. It precludes the use of all slang words, vulgar phrases, obsolete terms, foreign idioms, ambiguous expressions or any ungrammatical language whatsoever. Neither does it sanction the use of any newly coined word until such word is adopted by the best writers and speakers.

Perspicuity demands the clearest expression of thought conveyed in unequivocal language, so that there may be no misunderstanding whatever of the thought or idea the speaker or writer wishes to convey. All ambiguous words, words of double meaning and words that might possibly be construed in a sense different from that intended, are strictly forbidden. Perspicuity requires a style at once clear and comprehensive and entirely free from pomp and pedantry and affectation or any straining after effect.

Precision requires concise and exact expression, free from redundancy and tautology, a style terse and clear and simple enough to enable the hearer or reader to comprehend immediately the meaning of the speaker or writer. It forbids, on the one hand, all long and involved sentences, and, on the other, those that are too short and abrupt. Its object is to strike the golden mean in such a way as to rivet the attention of the hearer or reader on the words uttered or written.",Essentials of the English Language.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/LhI7LBaHbhjkiQyyLAXpbw/2mRQbuRFoKK8VXTTJ08dfz_CA-nKVBkKVo_SYjphg0d1FvmchPShRqBW1nJWZ828V8LHObToV04zSVZASus3D9jInfe2gAxrIynfSj_BYZv_jL5MB-m0qelGgSVwuPtv/wBHcaZ1oG8LUif6ZBivx6ks44X77n1TODU6GZNjSgrU),381
Master and Pupil,4,Short Story ,"There was once a man who had a son who was very clever at reading, and took great delight in it. He went out into the world to seek service somewhere, and as he was walking between some mounds he met a man, who asked him where he was going.
‘I am going about seeking for service,’ said the boy.
‘Will you serve me?’ asked the man.
‘Oh, yes; just as readily you as anyone else,’ said the boy.
‘But can you read?’ asked the man.
‘As well as the priest,’ said the boy.
Then I can’t have you,’ said the man. ‘In fact, I was just wanting a boy who couldn’t read. His only work would be to dust my old books.’
The man then went on his way, and left the boy looking after him.
‘It was a pity I didn’t get that place,’ thought he ‘That was just the very thing for me.’
Making up his mind to get the situation if possible, he hid himself behind one of the mounds, and turned his jacket outside in, so that the man would not know him again so easily. Then he ran along behind the mounds, and met the man at the other end of them.
‘Where are you going, my little boy?’ said the man, who did not notice that it was the same one he had met before.
‘I am going about seeking for service?’ said the boy.
‘Will you serve me?’ asked the man.
‘Oh, yes; just as readily you as anyone else,’ said the boy.
‘But can you read?’ said the man.
‘No, I don’t know a single letter,’ said the boy.
The man then took him into his service, and all the work he had to do was to dust his master’s books. But as he did this he had plenty of time to read them as well, and he read away at them until at last he was just as wise as his master—who was a great wizard—and could perform all kinds of magic. Among other feats, he could change himself into the shape of any animal, or any other thing that he pleased.
When he had learned all this he did not think it worth while staying there any longer, so he ran away home to his parents again. Soon after this there was a market in the next village, and the boy told his mother that he had learned how to change himself into the shape of any animal he chose.
‘Now,’ said he, ‘I shall change myself to a horse, and father can take me to market and sell me. I shall come home again all right.’
His mother was frightened at the idea, but the boy told her that she need not be alarmed; all would be well. So he changed himself to a horse, such a fine horse, too, that his father got a high price for it at the market; but after the bargain was made, and the money paid, the boy changed again to his own shape, when no one was looking, and went home.
The story spread all over the country about the fine horse that had been sold and then had disappeared, and at last the news came to the ears of the wizard.
‘Aha!’ said he, ‘this is that boy of mine, who befooled me and ran away; but I shall have him yet.’
The next time that there was a market the boy again changed himself to a horse, and was taken thither by his father. The horse soon found a purchaser, and while the two were inside drinking the luck-penny the wizard came along and saw the horse. He knew at once that it was not an ordinary one, so he also went inside, and offered the purchaser far more than he had paid for it, so the latter sold it to him.
The first thing the wizard now did was to lead the horse away to a smith to get a red-hot nail driven into its mouth, because after that it could not change its shape again. When the horse saw this it changed itself to a dove, and flew up into the air. The wizard at once changed himself into a hawk, and flew up after it. The dove now turned into a gold ring, and fell into a girl’s lap. 
The hawk now turned into a man, and offered the girl a great sum of money for the gold ring, but she would not part with it, seeing that it had fallen down to her, as it were, from Heaven. However, the wizard kept on offering her more and more for it, until at last the gold ring grew frightened, and changed itself into a grain of barley, which fell on the ground. The man then turned into a hen, and began to search for the grain of barley, but this again changed itself to a pole-cat, and took off the hen’s head with a single snap.
The wizard was now dead, the pole-cat put on human shape, and the youth afterwards married the girl, and from that time forward let all his magic arts alone.",Master and Pupil.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/7wFHa7Z71VKETwOxLmYktQ/tBXky6tPNwJEsUuJ0G3BEo8SGbG3yQdd5I_752QcUaDiIdrdq3dJxgU9yh2gawlCeMdBwlv3O1SylKSkQROj99JpnhT77hxYCjL4bLqWEA0/8DtOFdG9sk6fHMrwfBrk7Hoc_u_dw3dFrJprwPvzb7U),382

The Green House Effect,4,Informative Text,"The greenhouse effect is the process that takes place when certain gasses are trapped by a glass, or plastic, chamber that blocks out heat. It is the name given to the destruction of climate change. The greenhouse effect happens when gasses in the atmosphere trap infrared radiation emitted by the earth's surface, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Without these glasses, we would experience a warmer world than currently exists due to their warming properties.

Mainly, the greenhouse effect is when the sunlight that hits the earth's surface becomes trapped in the atmosphere with some of it being absorbed by greenhouse gasses. This traps heat and prevents it from escaping back out into space as well as causing more of it to be retained. Without this effect, our planet would be much too cold for life.

The greenhouse effect is the process by which a natural phenomenon leads to an altered state of the atmosphere and climate on earth. There are three distinctive parts to this effect: 1) The addition of aerosols, caused by either volcanic activity or human activity; 2) the sun angle, which reflects more heat into space when it is low in the sky, while at high noon it reflects less heat; and 3) the size of land area.

No wonder the earth we live on is getting warmer, it is because of the greenhouse effect. It is a natural phenomenon that occurs when gasses from the atmosphere get trapped below ground, warming up and melting to liquid form. Greenhouses are typically glass-paned structures which allow for radiant heating to exist even during winter. In some climates, greenhouses prevent snow from falling on plants and snow removal by cleaning off the roof system or covering over with natural materials such as dry leaves or straw

The greenhouse effect is caused by the release of gasses from factories and power plants, which trap heat and warm the atmosphere. Greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane are absorbed at lower latitudes than they are emitted, causing them to accumulate in the atmosphere around the middle of the world in one area. The greenhouse gasses are warmer so that they release heat into space and maintain their trapped state by preventing infrared light from escaping from earth's atmosphere.

While many people are still under the impression that greenhouse gasses, such as CO2, are harmful to our planet’s atmosphere and environment, there is a new scientific understanding of greenhouse gasses that is making news. Greenhouse gasses are actually not only harmless but actually essential for life on earth. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are two of the most important greenhouse gasses produced by human activities and both birds and plants need these glasses to grow healthy. An increase in carbon dioxide caused by human activity has elevated temperatures globally while methane gas emitted from oil and gas operations poses a particular threat to global food supply.",The Green House Effect.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Q7y38YR9EX6syfeNhdYNxg/88C0ccR_N5agulfWWkd93n0OGHEvyjR9ojv78HBSmIQbtCT4mZt5oCexAwnpVPqgpjZ0xjetXEbfSf3mzdo-1kxOcXIskEhhRD88qn5huvk/WCcSFJWj49y6DQWb0FzCRrgWY-agrrI2iqyIb64BQP4),384

Now the hen found a great big nut, but said nothing about it, and was going to eat it all alone, but the kernel was such a fat one that she could not swallow it down, and it stuck in her throat, so that she was afraid she would choke.
""Cock!"" cried she, ""run as fast as you can and fetch me some water, or I shall choke!""
So the cock ran as fast as he could to the brook, and said, ""Brook, give me some water, the hen is up yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat."" But the brook answered, ""First run to the bride and ask her for some red silk.""
So the cock ran to the bride and said,
""Bride, give me some red silk; the brook wants me to give him some red silk; I want him to give me some water, for the hen lies yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat.""
But the bride answered,
""First go and fetch me my garland that hangs on a willow."" And the cock ran to the willow and pulled the garland from the bag and brought it to the bride, and the bride gave him red silk, and he brought it to the brook, and the brook gave him water. 
So then the cock brought the water to the hen, but alas, it was too late; the hen had choked in the meanwhile, and lay there dead. And the cock was so grieved that he cried aloud, and all the beasts came and lamented for the hen; and six mice built a little waggon, on which to carry the poor hen to her grave, and when it was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove. On the way they met the fox.
""Halloa, cock,"" cried he, ""where are you off to?""
""To bury my hen,"" answered the cock.
""Can I come too?"" said the fox.
""Yes, if you follow behind,"" said the cock.
So the fox followed behind and he was soon joined by the wolf, the bear, the stag, the lion, and all the beasts in the wood. And the procession went on till they came to a brook.
""How shall we get over?"" said the cock. Now in the brook there was a straw, and he said,
""I will lay myself across, so that you may pass over on me."" But when the six mice had got upon this bridge, the straw slipped and fell into the water and they all tumbled in and were drowned. So they were as badly off as ever, when a coal came up and said he would lay himself across and they might pass over him; but no sooner had he touched the water than he hissed, went out, and was dead. 
A stone seeing this was touched with pity, and, wishing to help the cock, he laid himself across the stream. And the cock drew the waggon with the dead hen in it safely to the other side, and then began to draw the others who followed behind across too, but it was too much for him, the waggon turned over, and all tumbled into the water one on the top of another, and were drowned.
So the cock was left all alone with the dead hen, and he dug a grave and laid her in it, and he raised a mound above her, and sat himself down and lamented so sore that at last he died. And so they were all dead together.",The Death of the Hen.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/CetsE_7UGD4wg622NzpuPg/wPoBVEJVpInA1POtphUtp5Wex8t6hp5psHYwLeUXfidtTOfqjlTKIjIQzdgs7CnTbCQabCC1S64sSnEnQI9hFVLKLbBwYepamfJMOEccchM/gfoh19W5sNTpYIaWeNZh3phxO5h2sdH6lxmE8g79tz8),385

The Uses of Punctuation Marks - Semicolon and Colon ,4,Informative Text,"Uses of Semicolon
- The Semicolon marks a slighter connection than the comma. It is generally confined to separating the parts of compound sentences. It is much used in contrasts:
             ""Gladstone was great as a statesman; he was sublime as a man.""
- The Semicolon is used between the parts of all compound sentences in which the grammatical subject of the second part is different from that of the first: 

""The power of England relies upon the wisdom of her statesmen; the power of America upon the strength of her army and navy.""
- The Semicolon is used before words and abbreviations which introduce particulars or specifications following after, such as, namely, as, e.g., vid., i.e., etc.: 
""He had three defects; namely, carelessness, lack of concentration and obstinacy in his ideas.""
 ""An island is a portion of land entirely surrounded by water; as Cuba."" 
Uses of Colon
- The Colon except in conventional uses is practically obsolete.
- It is generally put at the end of a sentence introducing a long quotation: 
""The cheers having subsided, Mr. Bryan spoke as follows:""
- It is placed before an explanation or illustration of the subject under consideration: 

""This is the meaning of the term:""
- A direct quotation formally introduced is generally preceded by a colon: 

""The great orator made this funny remark:""
- The colon is often used in the title of books when the secondary or subtitle is in apposition to the leading one and when the conjunction or is omitted: 

""Acoustics: the Science of Sound.""
- It is used after the salutation in the beginning of letters: 

""Sir: My dear Sir: Gentlemen: Dear Mr. Jones:"" etc. 
In this connection a dash very often follows the colon.
- It is sometimes used to introduce details of a group of things already referred to in the mass: 
""The boy's excuses for being late were: firstly, he did not know the time, secondly, he was sent on an errand, thirdly, he tripped on a rock and fell by the wayside.""",The Uses of Punctuation Marks - Semicolon and Colon .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/z4NzrZPGnGL-feEwyyohBg/pC5iuu9k7PcLOrs5dPXsCVK8ZlQ3jIjMP6a1np68635Ggy_4uidzANa0fu-FpYP0tE-DMdd3lS1GqWrM1lxTbzCxtbWHEZP_9nE3uwbGW6gYxMkEaRgYJX6okqTs_bqK4_HXQmOxTFoupNwAYoon-A/2RFSJZuqVAIlbuCukoGRlyHzeahVbxLfKsWk4Rvoty0),387
The Shirt-Collar,4,Short Story ,"There was once a fine gentleman whose entire worldly possessions consisted of a boot-jack and a hair-brush; but he had the most beautiful shirt-collar in the world, and it is about this that we are going to hear a story.
The shirt-collar was so old that he began to think about marrying; and it happened one day that he and a garter came into the wash-tub together.
‘Hulloa!’ said the shirt-collar, ‘never before have I seen anything so slim and delicate, so elegant and pretty! May I be permitted to ask your name?’
‘I shan’t tell you,’ said the garter.
‘Where is the place of your abode?’ asked the shirt-collar.
But the garter was of a bashful disposition, and did not think it proper to answer.
‘Perhaps you are a girdle?’ said the shirt-collar, ‘an under girdle? for I see that you are for use as well as for ornament, my pretty miss!’
‘You ought not to speak to me!’ said the garter’ ‘I’m sure I haven’t given you any encouragement!’
‘When anyone is as beautiful as you,’ said the shirt-collar, ‘is not that encouragement enough?’
‘Go away, don’t come so close!’ said the garter. ‘You seem to be a gentleman!’
‘So I am, and a very fine one too!’ said the shirt-collar; ‘I possess a boot-jack and a hair-brush!’
That was not true; it was his master who owned these things; but he was a terrible booster.
‘Don’t come so close,’ said the garter. ‘I’m not accustomed to such treatment!’
‘What affectation!’ said the shirt-collar. And then they were taken out of the wash-tub, starched, and hung on a chair in the sun to dry, and then laid on the ironing-board. Then came the glowing iron.
‘Mistress widow!’ said the shirt-collar, ‘dear mistress widow! I am becoming another man, all my creases are coming out; you are burning a hole in me! Ugh! Stop, I implore you!’
‘You rag!’ said the iron, traveling proudly over the shirt-collar, for it thought it was a steam engine and ought to be at the station drawing trucks.
‘Rag!’ it said.
The shirt-collar was rather frayed out at the edge, so the scissors came to cut off the threads.
‘Oh!’ said the shirt-collar, ‘you must be a dancer! How high you can kick! That is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen! No man can imitate you!’
‘I know that!’ said the scissors.
‘You ought to be a duchess!’ said the shirt-collar. ‘My worldly possessions consist of a fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-brush. If only I had a duchy!’
‘What! He wants to marry me?’ said the scissors, and she was so angry that she gave the collar a sharp snip, so that it had to be cast aside as good for nothing.
‘Well, I shall have to propose to the hair-brush!’ thought the shirt-collar. ‘It is really wonderful what fine hair you have, madam! Have you ever thought of marrying?’
‘Yes, that I have!’ answered the hair-brush; ‘I’m engaged to the boot-jack!’
‘Engaged!’ exclaimed the shirt-collar. And now there was no one he could marry, so he took to despising matrimony.
Time passed, and the shirt-collar came in a rag-bag to the paper-mill. There was a large assortment of rags, the fine ones in one heap, and the coarse ones in another, as they should be. They had all much to tell, but no one more than the shirt-collar, for he was a hopeless braggart.
‘I have had a terrible number of love affairs!’ he said. ‘They give me no peace. I was such a fine gentleman, so stiff with starch! I had a boot-jack and a hair-brush, which I never used! You should just have seen me then! Never shall I forget my first love! She was a girdle, so delicate and soft and pretty! She threw herself into a wash-tub for my sake! Then there was a widow, who glowed with love for me. But I left her alone, till she became black. Then there was the dancer, who inflicted the wound which has caused me to be here now; she was very violent! My own hair-brush was in love with me, and lost all her hair in consequence. Yes, I have experienced much in that line; but I grieve most of all for the garter,-I mean, the girdle, who threw herself into a wash-tub. I have much on my conscience; it is high time for me to become white paper!’

And so he did! He became white paper, the very paper on which this story is printed. And that was because he had boasted so terribly about things which were not true. We should take this to heart, so that it may not happen to us, for we cannot indeed tell if we may not some day come to the rag-bag, and be made into white paper, on which will be printed our whole history, even the most secret parts, so that we too go about the world relating it, like the shirt-collar.",The Shirt-Collar.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/OnS6UDPLP9F7DTqIguetfw/XFtz7Zf-dzc0Q0imFnhQD23s7q0_y7vXz4YxZ0iNTS1JvmMIUDci5NWSzqU_CnPyOkCaNbL66aYQJHJkI-aNdWbQ07IPUFfKSyvy_kmjcVc/zbqayoSxfHpinNw3HJpbMXe8Cc0x1Kiv_9v9-fvgue0),388
Change About,4,Poem,"There was an old man, who lived in a wood,
As you may plainly see;
He said he could do as much work in a day,
As his wife could do in three.
""With all my heart,"" the old woman said,
""If that you will allow,
To-morrow you'll stay at home in my stead,
And I'll go drive the plough.

""But you must milk the Tidy cow,
For fear that she go dry;
And you must feed the little pigs
That are within the sty;
And you must mind the speckled hen,
For fear she lay away;
And you must reel the spool of yarn,
That I spun yesterday.""

The old woman took a staff in her hand,
And went to drive the plough:
The old man took a pail in his hand,
And went to milk the cow;
But Tidy hinched, and Tidy flinched,
And Tidy broke his nose,
And Tidy gave him such a blow,
That the blood ran down to his toes.

""High! Tidy! ho! Tidy! high!
Tidy! do stand still;
If ever I milk you, Tidy, again,
'Twill be sore against my will!""

He went to feed the little pigs
That were within the sty;
He hit his head against the beam,
And he made the blood to fly.
He went to mind the speckled hen,
For fear she'd lay astray,
And he forgot the spool of yarn
His wife spun yesterday.

So he swore by the sun, the moon, and the stars,
And the green leaves on the tree,
""If my wife doesn't do a day's work in her life,
She shall ne'er be ruled by me.""",Change About.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/GAypTdtf9D7L4dFbwr_oyg/uXZNg3APS5d8evcGurS-imlNNLrkW_60iadEzqS2xUfAyPkh6VXYEAdhI6w1PVtO4nWLnBgKmkNidIQekAP_d2Bslm9PkBOeoQ16dhwa1Gw/OwViuHFomxar00_8cn1__RFpIDLK1fVUks0kicq-J8U),389
How Do Cats Communicate?,4,Informative Text,"Cats communicate in many ways. They vocalize, use body language, take action, and release scents.
- The Vocal Cat: 
Cats make three types of sounds.
- Murmurs - which includes purrs, trills, and chirrups
- Meows - which includes the basic ""meow,"" mews, and calls
- Aggressive Sounds - which includes growls, snarls, hisses, yowls, shrieks, and spits.
Murmurs
Purring is an ongoing, gentle vibrating sound that indicates a positive state in the cat. However, cats are also known to purr in stressful situations, like when they are seriously injured, in pain, sick or tense. It is believed cats purr when they are content, need a friend, or giving thanks for care, such as when a vet treats an injured or sick cat and gets a purr for it.
Kittens learn trilling from their mothers as she will use it to tell her babies to follow her. Adult cats trill in greeting, usually to another feline. A trill sounds like a short purr and meow combined.
Chirrups are meows that roll off the tongue. Mother cats use chirrups to call her young from the nest. It is also used by friendly felines when approaching a human or another cat. Cats make excited chirrups and chatters when watching or stalking prey.
Meows
The most known sound cats make is the ""meow."" Kitties meow mostly for humans and can be plaintive, assertive, welcoming, bold, friendly, attention seeking, complaining or demanding. Sometimes the meow is silent with the feline opening her mouth but nothing comes out.
Mews are soft, early sounds kittens make and are used to get mother's attention.
Calls are made by females in heat and are known as ""caterwauling."" Males as well make calls when fighting, especially over females during mating.
Aggressive Sounds
Growling, hissing, snarling, and spitting are vocalizations cats make when in either defensive or offensive mode. These danger sounds are often combined with body posturing to affect a threat, for instance when a cat puffs up his fur and hisses at a dog that gets too close. When growling, the puss is giving a warning of ""back off before you get the claws.""
Cats hiss when angry, startled, afraid or hurt. A feline invading another's territory will get hissed and growled at, and if he doesn't leave, he may get attacked.
- Body Language
Cats use body language to express a wide range of emotions. To communicate fear or aggression, the cat will arch her back, puff out her fur, and use a sideways position. And to signal relaxation, the cat's eyes will slowly blink or have his eyes half open. This body language is communicated through the feline's facial expressions, tail, body and coat posturing.
Posturing
When cats become aggressive, their back end goes up with stiffened hind legs, tail fur fluffed out, nose pointed forward, and ears flat. Such posture indicates danger, and the cat will attack. This form of feline communication is meant to frighten off an aggressor and prevent an attack. It is a warning.
A scared, defensive feline will make himself smaller, lowering his body to the ground while arching his back and leaning away from the threat.
Cats can show comfort or trust when lying on their back and exposing the belly. However, this may also indicate the cat is about to defend himself with sharp claws and teeth. Playfulness is indicated with an open mouth with no teeth exposed.
Ears
A cat's ears can reveal various states of mind. With ears erect, the feline is focused and alert. Relaxed ears show the cat is calm. Flattened ears happen when the feline is extremely aggressive or defensive.
Eyes
Staring communicates a threat or challenge and is an indicator of hierarchy with lower-ranking cats withdrawing from a stare down by a higher-ranking feline. This stare is used often for territory or predatory reasons.
Tail
A cat's tail is a great communicator. For instance, a tail swinging from side-to-side in a slow and lazy fashion shows the cat is relaxed. A twitching tail occurs in hunting or when the cat is irritated or displeased and can occur before an attack, playful or otherwise.
When playing, kittens and younger cats will put the base of their tail up high and stiffen the tail except for an upside down u-shape, signaling excitement and even hyperactivity. This tail position can also be seen when chasing other cats or running about by themselves.
Surprised or scared, a cat may erect the fur on its tail and back.
- Physical
Grooming & Other Forms of Affection
Cats show affection with other cats and some humans by grooming, licking, and kneading. When a feline purrs and kneads at the same time, she is communicating affection and contentment.
A friendly greeting between cats occurs when they touch noses and sniff each other. Bumping heads and cheek rubbing between kitties displays dominance toward a subordinate cat.
A friendly greeting with a human is shown by face rubbing. The feline pushes her face into the person relating affection. The ""head-bump"" is another way cats reveal positive feelings for a human. Leg rubbing is another form of affection.
As cats rub and push against another cat or a human, they are spreading their scent, which is a form of marking territory.
Biting
Strong biting accompanied by growling, hissing or posturing displays aggression. Light bites show playfulness and affection, especially when combined with purring and kneading.
Another way biting is used by cats to communicate is through mating. The male will bite the scruff of the female's neck, and she will get into the lordosis, revealing she is ready to mate.
- Smells
Cats use their own scent to communicate with other cats. By rubbing and head-bumping, kitties use scent glands in their face, tail, paws, and lower back to spread their scent. As well, they use feces, urine, and spraying to leave a message to other cats.
Spraying marks the cat's territory, both indoors and out. Leaving urine and feces is also used to mark a cat's domain. Additionally, rubbing their scent on objects, like a fence post, marks territory.
Spraying males do the most frequent territory marking. Tomcats spray not only to mark their domain but also to let other toms know the females nearby are his for the mating. Tomcat spray is a strong smelling marker. Sometimes females will spray, too.
And that's how cats communicate.",How Do Cats Communicate.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/MHCAjESZEC1amt2ELuwG6A/uxA_7zWDZ1SlZW3PwmWgp1B6r6cvtrj3hnYmZ3cHLikJgk_KxgPX8TMvdA5U8pULtT2wciYSqzZMi945CbfW_AShFkosNyQ28gdqeBrxzUs/fYEntw2icFBdm34fnyEYytyAi0EQzRubf_ZDJ0xGjJA),390
Wonderwings,4,Short Story ,"Poppypink sat up in bed and yawned. ""Why is everybody getting up so early?"" she asked. ""Is it a holiday?""
The older fairies were dressing themselves and brushing their long fine hair. ""Wonderwings is coming to see us,"" they said. ""Jump up, little Poppypink.""
""Who is Wonderwings?"" she asked.
""You will see when you are dressed. Hurry, or you will miss her.""
""Oh dear! I am so sleepy,"" said Poppypink, and she yawned again. ""I don't care about Wonderwings."" She snuggled down into the bedclothes again, and went to sleep.
Presently she was awakened by the sound of the sweetest singing she had ever heard, and a flash of brilliant color went past her window pane of crystal set in pearl.
""That must be Wonderwings,"" she said. ""Oh, I must see her. I hope I am not too late.""
She sprang from bed and dressed so hurriedly that I am afraid her hair did not receive its due amount of brushing. Then she ran out into the garden.
The older fairies stood all in a group, saying loudly ""I will go,"" and ""I will go."" And before them, scarcely touching the ground with the tip of her foot, stood poised a glorious fairy, taller than any other there. She was altogether beautiful; and her wings—as soon as Poppypink saw them she knew why the visitor had been called Wonderwings. For they reached high above her head and almost to the ground, and they glowed with so many colors that it seemed as if a million jewels had been Hung upon them and had stuck, growing into a million flashing stars that made a million little rainbows with every sway and movement of her body.
""How lovely! Oh, how lovely!"" cried Poppypink. She crept nearer to the beautiful fairy and sat among the daisies at her feet. ""See,"" she cried. ""My wings are small and colorless. Tell me how I may grow wings like yours."" Just as little girls adore beautiful hair, so do little fairies adore beautiful wings.
Wonderwings smiled down at her. ""Such wings as mine are only to be won in sadder lands than these,"" she said. ""If you have them you must leave your fairyland and come where humans live, and where hunger and sorrow and death trample the city streets.""
""I will come!"" cried Poppypink. ""I will come!""
""Come then,"" said Wonderwings. She took the little fairy's hand, and up they all rose into the clear air, flying far and far away till they left their fairyland behind and came at last to the sadder lands where humans lived. Their Wonderwings showed them where hunger and sorrow and death trampled the city streets, and the band of fairies flew lower and lower to look.
""The children tumble and fight in the dirty lanes, and cry for bread,"" cried Poppypink. ""The little ones, I cannot bear to hear them sob.""
""Perhaps you can help them,"" said Wonderwings.
""I am only a little fairy. What can I do?"" asked Poppypink. ""I have no bread to give them.""
She flew a little lower, to gaze at them more nearly. ""What can I do?"" she asked again.
No answer came. She looked around, and found herself alone. Wonderwings and the older fairies had in a moment gone from sight.
Below, a crippled child sat among rags in a dark corner of a dreary room, and tears ran down her cheeks. ""The sunshine, the pretty yellow sunshine!"" she wailed. ""If only I could run and play in the pretty sunshine!""
""Here is something I can do,"" thought Poppypink. She gathered armfuls of the golden sunbeams, and flying with them through the glass as only a fairy can fly, herself unseen, she heaped them over the twisted hands and pale thin face of the child, and left her playing with them and smiling happily.
Lower she flew to help the little ones who cried about the gutters. She led the starving and shelterless to comfort, the toddlers to safety; she brought a flower to the hopeless, ease to sick ones racked with pain; at night she flew with glittering dreams from room to room, so that even sad-eyed feeble babies laughed for pleasure in their sleep. Day after day, night after night she toiled, for weeks and months and years. There was so much to do! The time passed like a moment. She was so busy that she had forgotten all about her wings.
One day there came a flash of color in the air beside her, and Wonderwings and all the older fairies stood around her. ""Dear Poppypink,"" cried one, ""how your wings have grown! And how beautiful they are! They are so tall that they reach above your head and almost to the ground, and they glow with so many colors that it seems as if a million jewels had been flung upon them and had stuck, growing into a million flashing stars that make a million little rainbows with every sway and movement of your body.""
Poppypink laughed with joy. ""I am so glad, so very glad!"" she said. ""I had forgotten all about my wings.""
""Yet they have grown with use,"" said Wonderwings; ""and for every deed of kindness done a star has sprung, to shine in beauty there for evermore.""",Wonderwings.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/PpYQ9U2io0bZabMuUtCUdQ/uhLU9daLKEvDbiiRZCLQkrt-wMLtP1Qv1j3yKW9cDKrDI8dkSF5_UI0UrL7MiQYlyeCbAZCQH8tizsdpNDXcnzCSnKmshnDrxy6yiYpq8X4/_eDnBu0YT5OUTNkfU85ilQ5jACzCGKH75fKrOlQFeR4),391

Rules for Use and Arrangement of Words,4,Informative Text,"Rules for the Use and Arrangement of Words

The following rules for the use and arrangement of words will be found helpful in securing clearness and force.
- Use words in their proper sense.
- Avoid useless circumlocutions and ""fine writing.""
- Avoid exaggerations.
- Be careful in the use of not ... and, any, but, only, not ... or, that.
- Be careful in the use of ambiguous words, e. g., certain.
- Be careful in the use of he, it, they, these, etc.
- Report a speech in the first person where necessary to avoid ambiguity.
- Use the third person where the exact words of the speaker are not intended to be given.
- When you use a participle implying when, while, though, or that, show clearly by the context what is implied.
- When using the relative pronoun, use who or which, if the meaning is and he or and it, for he or for it.
- Do not use which and which for which.
- Repeat the antecedent before the relative where the non-repetition causes any ambiguity.
- Use particular for general terms. Avoid abstract nouns.

- Do not mix metaphor with literal statements.
- Do not use poetic metaphor to illustrate a prosaic subject.
- Emphatic words must stand in emphatic positions; i. e., for the most part, at the beginning or the end of the sentence.
- Unemphatic words must, as a rule, be kept from the end.
- The Subject, if unusually emphatic, should often be transferred from the beginning of the sentence.
- The object is sometimes placed before the verb for emphasis.
- Where several words are emphatic make it clear which is the most emphatic. Emphasis can sometimes be given by adding an epithet, or an intensifying word.
- Words should be as near as possible to the words with which they are grammatically connected.
- Adverbs should be placed next to the words they are intended to qualify.
- Only; the strict rule is that only should be placed before the word it affects.

- At least, always, and other adverbial adjuncts sometimes produce ambiguity.
- Nouns should be placed near the nouns that they define.
- Pronouns should follow the nouns to which they refer without the intervention of any other noun.
- Clauses that are grammatically connected should be kept as close together as possible. Avoid parentheses.
- In conditional sentences the antecedent or ""if-clauses"" must be kept distinct from the consequent clauses.
- Dependent clauses preceded by that should be kept distinct from those that are independent.
- Where there are several infinitives those that are dependent on the same word must be kept distinct from those that are not.
- In a sentence with if, when, though, etc. put the ""if-clause"" first.
- Repeat the subject where its omission would cause obscurity or ambiguity.
- Repeat a preposition after an intervening conjunction especially if a verb and an object also intervene.
- Repeat conjunctions, auxiliary verbs, and pronominal adjectives.

The Babies in the Wood,4,Short Story ,"A great many years ago three little girls lived in an old-fashioned house in the East. They had a very lovely home, and a kind father and mother, who tried to make them happy. All through the summer they used to roam over the hills and fields, catching butterflies, watching the birds and bees at work, and studying the flowers and trees in the beautiful meadows and woods. Then when winter came, and the days grew cold, they went to school; and in the evening, when the fire was burning brightly, they read and studied in books about all they had seen in the summer.
Besides all these lovely things, and perhaps best of all, they had a very large yard to play in, so large that it took up a whole block, and seemed like a little farm in the middle of the town. There was a lovely lawn and flower beds; a vegetable garden, barnyard and stable; and an orchard where all kinds of fruit trees grew, apple, peach, pear, and many others. 
A cow lived down in the meadows of clover, and old Bob, the horse, was sometimes turned out to pasture there. But nicest of all, there was the wood yard. You must remember that every winter, where these little girls lived, the snow fell, and lay so deep on the roads that no one could bring in wood from the forest, and without it all the people would have frozen in their cold homes.
So every September the gates were thrown wide open, and into the yard load after load of wood was drawn and piled up under the shed. Then, when it was too cold to play out on the hills, the little girls used to have a fine time in the yard, piling up the wood, making beds, tables, chairs, and stoves of the sticks that had once been the waving branches and strong, sturdy trunks of trees.
Toward spring they often found a strange yellow powder on the ground under the wood. At first they played with it, calling it flour, and made pies and cakes out of it. But at last they began to wonder where the flour came from, and after watching and studying a long time this is what they found out.
But first I must tell you that all the time the three little girls were happy and busy in this beautiful place, they were not the only family there. There were the robins' children, whose mammas were trying to make them good and happy too. There were the beatles' children, the ants' children, and families of toads, butterflies, and spiders. And while the three little girls were playing with the sticks of wood, there lay, tucked snugly away inside of them, many families of children, warm and safe in their wooden home.
Now I want the smallest of you little children to hold up her hand. How small it is compared to your body! Now let us see the little finger on that hand,—it is smaller still; and now look at the nail on that finger: the brothers and sisters of one of these families were altogether about as large as that tiny nail.
Their mamma was a wasp, with light, gauzy wings and a strong body with a long sting on the end of it, about the length of a needle. With this little sting or saw, as it really was, she had bored many holes in the wood when it was still a green tree, and at the bottom of each hole she had laid a tiny egg. There it lay for a long time, all white and still, until one day it cracked open, and out came a funny little white grub, with six short white feet, and black jaws very strong and large for such a tiny thing. This little creature had never had anything to eat, and as it was very hungry indeed, it fell to eating—what do you think? 
Wood—its own house! You wouldn't like a stick of wood for your breakfast, I know, but the wasp-mamma knew what her little grub-children would want, so she put them in just the right place; for they couldn't have eaten anything else. And the hungry little grubs ate and ate and ate as long as they could, pushing away from the hole the part they did not want, and this fell upon the ground as the strange yellow powder the children found in the wood-yard, every spring.
And so, while the little girls were placing away in the sunshine the little grubs were eating away in the wood, until at last, one day, they grew satisfied, and one after another went to sleep. There they lay in their dark homes, fast asleep, through long weeks, while the snow was melting and the grass coming up, and the birds and bees beginning their summer work again; until one day these lazy little creatures, that had never done anything in their lives but eat and sleep, woke up and began to stretch themselves. But what had happened to them? 
Instead of the soft white bodies they had gone to sleep with, they now had black ones and four gauzy wings; while six slender legs had taken the place of the six short ones. There were still the strong black jaws to do all needful work with, and in addition, delicate mouth-parts, for their food was now to be the honey from flowers. In fact, they looked and were just like their mamma, the gauzy wasp. One after another they crept to the end of the passage that led from their dark homes to the bright world without. They stood one minute at the little dark hole, and then, spreading their wings, flitted out into the beautiful world of sunshine and flowers.",The Babies in the Wood.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/lKVXUuZiBSbujkxkU_tSsQ/enTfZznLpEFKwJ_VZipBCjWb7Dzhhm08lX7kwbJdlFJ2aMjkgdy_p5nzWAdDkOA52EtNqe-g98rkhKd5GC3q3ikMnDuxqv9ii5ak4snkjjk/yU-OoYXRy4nqgrJsTO2dHFjEMibYCTijUdKvlBMUdhw),394
What the Burdock Was Good For,4,Poem,"""Good for nothing,"" the farmer said,
As he made a sweep at the burdock's head;
""But then, it is best, no doubt,
To come some day and root her out.""
So he lowered his scythe, and went his way,
To see his corn or gather his hay;
And the weed grew safe and strong and tall,
Close by the side of the garden wall.

""Good for home,"" cried the little toad,
As he hopped up out of the dusty road.
He had just been having a dreadful fright,—
The boy who gave it was yet in sight.
Here it was cool, and dark and green,
The safest kind of a leafy screen.
The toad was happy, ""For,"" said he,
""The burdock was plainly meant for me.""

""Good for a prop,"" the spider thought,
And to and fro with care he wrought,
Till he fastened it well to an evergreen,
And spun his cables fine between.
'Twas a beautiful bridge,—a triumph of skill,—
The flies came round, as idlers will;
The spider lurked in his corner dim;
The more that came the better for him.

""Good for play,"" said the child perplext
To know what frolic was coming next;
So she gathered the burrs, that all despised,
And her city playmates were quite surprised
To see what a beautiful basket or chair
Could be made, with a little time and care.
They ranged their treasures about with pride,
And played all day by the burdock's side.

Nothing is lost in this world of ours;
Honey comes from the idle flowers;
The weed which we pass in utter scorn,
May save a life by another morn;
Wonder awaits us at every turn.
We must be silent and gladly learn,
No room for recklessness or abuse,
Since even a burdock has its use.",What the Burdock Was Good For.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/DDF-BTUzLm5VMxSDx5Uphg/ZR_qf0b38WJatso5nupunu5TYk4wU_qAxPU1l6x4Tz1SoBke7ZKtyV9k0TVP2TJAoSq_sPnmZFVJlRp9BEgaQt1tBMmjA8nt6_vpOYHjYULM0hbSkAJQKC9kkhgpPS1i/i52Ci2o757hmjTDink74WObAMVx3o6j0H9FwlmIYahI),395

"The Mouse, the Bird and the Sausage",4,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, a mouse and a bird and a sausage lived and kept house together in perfect peace among themselves, and in great prosperity. It was the bird's business to fly to the forest every day and bring back wood. The mouse had to draw the water, make the fire, and set the table; and the sausage had to do the cooking. Nobody is content in this world: much will have more! One day the bird met another bird on the way, and told him of his excellent condition in life. But the other bird called him a poor simpleton to do so much work, while the two others led easy lives at home.
When the mouse had made up her fire and drawn water, she went to rest in her little room until it was time to lay the cloth. The sausage stayed by the saucepans, looked to it that the victuals were well cooked, and just before dinner-time he stirred the broth or the stew three or four times well round himself, so as to enrich and season and flavor it. Then the bird used to come home and lay down his load, and they sat down at the table, and after a good meal they would go to bed and sleep their fill till the next morning. It really was a most satisfactory life.
But the bird came to the resolution the next day never again to fetch wood: he had, he said, been their slave long enough, now they must change about and make a new arrangement So in spite of all the mouse and the sausage could say, the bird was determined to have his own way. So they drew lots to settle it, and it fell so that the sausage was to fetch wood, the mouse was to cook, and the bird was to draw water.
Now see what happened. The sausage went away after wood, the bird made up the fire, and the mouse put it on the pot, and they waited until the sausage should come home, bringing the wood for the next day. But the sausage was absent so long that they thought something must have happened to him, and the bird went part of the way to see if he could see anything of him. Not far off he met with a dog on the road, who, looking upon the sausage as lawful prey, had picked him up, and made an end of him. The bird then lodged a complaint against the dog as an open and flagrant robber, but it was all no good, as the dog declared that he had found forged letters upon the sausage, so that he deserved to lose his life.
The bird then very sadly took up the wood and carried it home himself, and related to the mouse all he had seen and heard. They were both very troubled, but determined to look on the bright side of things, and still to remain together. And so the bird laid the cloth, and the mouse prepared the food, and finally got into the pot, as the sausage used to do, to stir and flavor the broth, but then she had to part with fur and skin, and lastly with life!
And when the bird came to dish up the dinner, there was no cook to be seen; and he turned over the heap of wood, and looked and looked, but the cook never appeared again. By accident the wood caught fire, and the bird hastened to fetch water to put it out, but he let fall the bucket in the well, and himself after it, and as he could not get out again, he was obliged to be drowned.","""The Mouse, the Bird and the Sausage.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Ke2isMLEHQ8oNbOh9gajUQ/LNrSZeuMiu_j54p8r1TCOJ_rQUzU9J5j7jSWGp_EVbV5C0Y1CowRz2fdS9_GbQW85WAsRpGKhEoN49DUChcnS61i2Jja7P-3JHvzRG_BShQJSzkY3Jn34MgJGNpezkha/k99enR82n5tJ2HcF4c56l-owI4p436sy6EW4jDbjJdM)""",397
The Child and the World,4,Poem,"     I see a nest in a green elm-tree
     With little brown sparrows,—one, two, three!
     The elm-tree stretches its branches wide,
     And the nest is soft and warm inside.
     At morn, the sun, so golden bright,
     Climbs up to fill the world with light;
     It opens the flowers, it wakens me,
     And wakens the birdies,—one, two, three.
     And leaning out of my window high,
     I look far up at the blue, blue sky,
     And then far out at the earth so green,
     And think it the loveliest ever seen,—
     The loveliest world that ever was seen!

     But by and by, when the sun is low,
     And birds and babies sleepy grow,
     I peep again from my window high,
     And look at the earth and clouds and sky.
     The night dew comes in silent showers,
     To cool the hearts of thirsty flowers;
     The moon comes out,—the slender thing,
     A crescent yet, but soon a ring,—
     And brings with her one yellow star;
     How small it looks, away so far!
     But soon, in the heaven's shining blue,
     A thousand twinkle and blink at you,
     Like a thousand lamps in the sky so blue.

     And hush! a light breeze stirs the tree,
     And rocks, the birdies,—one, two, three.
     What a beautiful cradle, that soft, warm nest!
     What a dear little coverlid, mamma-bird's breast!
     She's hugging them close to her,—tight, so tight
     That each downy head is hid from sight;
     But out from under her sheltering wings
     Their bright eyes glisten,—the darling things!
     I lean far out from my window's height
     And say, “Dear, lovely world, good-night!

     “Good-night, dear, pretty baby moon!
     Your cradle you'll outgrow quite soon,
     And then, perhaps, all night you'll shine,
     A grown-up lady moon!—so fine
     And bright that all the stars
     Will want to light their lamps from yours.
     Sleep sweetly, birdies, never fear,
     For God is always watching near!
     And you, dear, friendly world above,
     The same One holds us in His love:
     Both you so great, and I so small,
     Are safe,—He sees the sparrow's fall,—
     The dear God watcheth over all!”",The Child and the World.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/NxFb8vgT6zm-2RoZWcnrkg/7BEemMYoau6QAgh2mH3m3gVNfwu-qMSsDSZP2tiOzNEMdtMztiQ0CmWQOG6-d4_li44w6o7nqZMI2FKRqJmKqkkW9uP9Ky9ycXNvQjB5as4/VANuBUm3C_BInVeHDBNId3eDT_ggbvfDuiLOsnIwi9Q),398
Use of Shall and Will,4,Informative Text,"Use of Shall and Will: The use of the auxiliaries, shall and will, with their past tenses, is a source of very many errors. The following outline will show the correct use of shall and will, except in dependent clauses and questions:
- To indicate simple futurity or probability: Use shall with I and we; use will with all other subjects.
- To indicate promise, determination, threat, or command on the part of the speaker; i. e., action which the speaker means to control; Use will with I and we; use shall with all other subjects.

Examine the following examples of the correct use of shall and will:

Statements as to probable future events:
- We shall probably be there.
- I think you will want to be there.
- It will rain before night.

Statements of determination on the part of the speaker:
- I will come in spite of his command.
- You shall go home.
- It shall not happen again, I promise you.

Shall and Will in Questions: In interrogative sentences shall should always be used with the first person. In the second and third persons that auxiliary should be used which is logically expected in the answer.

Examine the agreement in the use of shall and will in the following questions and answers:

    QUESTIONS	                                       ANSWERS
Shall I miss the car?	                                    You will miss it.
Shall you be there?	                           I think I shall (probability).
Will he do it?	                                         I think he will (assertion).
Shall your son obey the teacher?	               He shall (determination).
Will you promise to come?	               We will come (promise).

Shall and Will in Dependent Clauses: In dependent clauses which are introduced by that, expressed or understood, the auxiliary should be used which would be proper if the dependent clause were a principal clause. The sentence, They assure us that they shall come, is wrong. The direct assurance would be, We will come. The auxiliary, then, in a principal clause would be will. Will should, therefore, be the auxiliary in the dependent construction, and the sentence should read, They assure us that they will come. 

Further examples:
- I suppose we shall have to pay.
- He thinks that you will be able to do it.
- He has decided that John shall replace the book.

In all dependent clauses expressing a condition or contingency use shall with all subjects. 

Examples;
- If he shall go to Europe, it will be his tenth trip abroad.
- If you shall go away, who will run the farm?
- If I shall die, I shall die as an honest man.",Use of Shall and Will.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/s3kYLZXrXyY7ZxYizIIO-A/KQzNJUymjoAVL8xb1fFaRa67Q_yGtxvbb54iYvIEGAFHR3ey6RC9mxBjErDXaBVQSccyE3gWOQ9M57SDZzTdId0gtz2U51_6rcuO6dVZIpg/RtccfOEpU5BlcnjiAAA_ZR28v3tRjL6GWB-zN34dZZQ),399
The Queen Bee,4,Short Story ,"Two king's sons once started to seek adventures, and fell into a wild, reckless way of living, and gave up all thoughts of going home again. Their third and youngest brother, who was called Witling, and had remained behind, started off to seek them; and when at last he found them, they jeered at his simplicity in thinking that he could make his way in the world, while they who were so much cleverer were unsuccessful. But they all three went on together until they came to an ant-hill, which the two eldest brothers wished to stir up, that they might see the little ants hurry about in their fright and carrying off their eggs, but Witling said,
""Leave the little creatures alone, I will not suffer them to be disturbed.""
And they went on farther until they came to a lake, where a number of ducks were swimming about. The two eldest brothers wanted to catch a couple and cook them, but Witling would not allow it, and said, ""Leave the creatures alone, I will not suffer them to be killed.""
And then they came to a bee's-nest in a tree, and there was so much honey in it that it overflowed and ran down the trunk. The two eldest brothers then wanted to make a fire beneath the tree, that the bees might be stifled by the smoke, and then they could get at the honey. But Witling prevented them, saying,
""Leave the little creatures alone, I will not suffer them to be stifled.""
At last the three brothers came to a castle where there were in the stables many horses standing, all of stone, and the brothers went through all the rooms until they came to a door at the end secured with three locks, and in the middle of the door a small opening through which they could look into the room. And they saw a little grey-haired man sitting at a table. They called out to him once, twice, and he did not hear, but on the third time he got up, undid the locks, and came out. 
Without speaking a word he led them to a table loaded with all sorts of good things, and when they had eaten and drunk he showed to each his bed-chamber. The next morning the little grey man came to the eldest brother, and beckoning him, brought him to a table of stone, on which were written three things directing by what means the castle could be delivered from its enchantment. 
The first thing was, that in the wood under the moss lay the pearls belonging to the princess—a thousand in number—and they were to be sought for and collected, and if he who should undertake the task had not finished it by sunset,—if but one pearl were missing,—he must be turned to stone. So the eldest brother went out, and searched all day, but at the end of it he had only found one hundred; just as was said on the table of stone came to pass and he was turned into stone. The second brother undertook the adventure the next day, but it fared with him no better than with the first; he found two hundred pearls, and was turned into stone.
And so at last it was Witling's turn, and he began to search in the moss; but it was a very tedious business to find the pearls, and he grew so out of heart that he sat down on a stone and began to weep. As he was sitting thus, up came the ant-king with five thousand ants, whose lives had been saved through Witling's pity, and it was not very long before the little insects had collected all the pearls and put them in a heap.
Now the second thing ordered by the table of stone was to get the key of the princess's sleeping-chamber out of the lake.
And when Witling came to the lake, the ducks whose lives he had saved came swimming, and dived below, and brought up the key from the bottom. The third thing that had to be done was the most difficult, and that was to choose out the youngest and loveliest of the three princesses, as they lay sleeping. 
All bore a perfect resemblance each to the other, and only differed in this, that before they went to sleep each one had eaten a different sweetmeat,—the eldest a piece of sugar, the second a little syrup, and the third a spoonful of honey. Now the Queen-bee of those bees that Witling had protected from the fire came at this moment, and trying the lips of all three, settled on those of the one that had eaten honey, and so it was that the king's son knew which to choose. Then the spell was broken; every one awoke from stony sleep, and took their right form again.
And Witling married the youngest and loveliest princess, and became king after her father's death. But his two brothers had to put up with the two other sisters.",The Queen Bee.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/L0Jlvlcvd-tUwqr3geuFcA/QHFB8FQLccN84ELve3-v-Ki4s5DsHqahVuc5Ero3dzEDI_3TQCScYaQuXiWGtoPO227LoXHbf4FydGhHhpTmHP8lulK3pkyWYCf1PtwBtco/oCHNpUUxXKhffyUHXiZaneNGKOhKQpIRT3C0zmniPxw),400
Buster Bear Goes Fishing,5,Short Story ,"Buster Bear yawned as he lay on his comfortable bed of leaves and watched the first early morning sunbeams creeping through the Green Forest to chase out the Black Shadows. Once more he yawned, and slowly got to his feet and shook himself. Then he walked over to a big pine-tree, stood up on his hind legs, reached as high up on the trunk of the tree as he could, and scratched the bark with his great claws. After that he yawned until it seemed as if his jaws would crack, and then sat down to think what he wanted for breakfast.
While he sat there, trying to make up his mind what would taste best, he was listening to the sounds that told of the waking of all the little people who live in the Green Forest. He heard Sammy Jay way off in the distance screaming, ""Thief! Thief!"" and grinned. ""I wonder,"" thought Buster, ""if someone has stolen Sammy's breakfast, or if he has stolen the breakfast of someone else. Probably he is the thief himself.""
He heard Chatterer the Red Squirrel scolding as fast as he could make his tongue go and working himself into a terrible rage. ""Must be that Chatterer got out of bed the wrong way this morning,"" thought he.
He heard Blacky the Crow cawing at the top of his lungs, and he knew by the sound that Blacky was getting into mischief of some kind. He heard the sweet voices of happy little singers, and they were good to hear. But most of all he listened to a merry, low, silvery laugh that never stopped but went on and on, until he just felt as if he must laugh too. It was the voice of the Laughing Brook. And as Buster listened it suddenly came to him just what he wanted for breakfast.
""I'm going fishing,"" said he in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice to no one in particular. ""Yes, Sir, I'm going fishing. I want some fat trout for my breakfast.""
He shuffled along over to the Laughing Brook, and straight to a little pool of which he knew, and as he drew near he took the greatest care not to make the teeniest, weeniest bit of noise. Now it just happened that early as he was, someone was before Buster Bear. When he came in sight of the little pool, who should he see but another fisherman there, who had already caught a fine fat trout. Who was it? Why, Little Joe Otter to be sure. He was just climbing up the bank with the fat trout in his mouth. Buster Bear's own mouth watered as he saw it. Little Joe sat down on the bank and prepared to enjoy his breakfast. He hadn't seen Buster Bear, and he didn't know that he or any one else was anywhere near.
Buster Bear tiptoed up very softly until he was right behind Little Joe Otter. ""Woof, woof!"" he said in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly voice. ""That's a very fine looking trout. I wouldn't mind if I had it myself.""
Little Joe Otter gave a frightened squeal and without even turning to see who was speaking dropped his fish and dived headfirst into the Laughing Brook. Buster Bear sprang forward and with one of his big paws caught the fat trout just as it was slipping back into the water.
""Here's your trout, Mr. Otter,"" said he, as Little Joe put his head out of water to see who had frightened him. ""Come and get it.""
But Little Joe wouldn't. The fact is, he was afraid to. He snarled at Buster Bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could think of. Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as if he thought it all a great joke and repeated his invitation to Little Joe to come and get his fish. But Little Joe just turned his back and went off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage.
""It's too bad to waste such a fine fish,"" said Buster thoughtfully. ""I wonder what I'd better do with it."" And while he was wondering, he ate it all up. Then he started down the Laughing Brook to try to catch some for himself.",Buster Bear Goes Fishing.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/-idvtaF0JMGRtKP-Fl9a0w/jRsYsBceWJPneOdLKBz-JsFqZ0CYRIPPXEfqTNThkPLyd1RaUOyRlciUZ7X5qYLPVxKpIWdBIhLyUZ__SFAzHUHWPLRC8VQk49UZ2rmsl3heJ9hYA0oC0N-PecWt52kf/4LDdAqI-l7yJQzMnNLnGDyTPYCO5CXGy7f0lUM1B5E0),401
Winter,5,Poem,"Down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak,
From the snow five thousand summers old;
On open wold and hill-top bleak
It had gathered all the cold,
And whirled it like sleet on the wanderer's cheek.
It carried a shiver everywhere
From the unleafed boughs and pastures bare;
The little brook heard it and built a roof
'Neath which he could house him winter-proof;
All night by the white stars' frosty gleams
He groined his arches and matched his beams;
Slender and clear were his crystal spars

Accusation of Socrates,5,Short Story ,"Socrates, as you know, was one of the best and gentlest of men, yet he had many enemies. These were principally the people who were jealous of him and of his renown for great wisdom; for his reputation was so well established, that the oracle at Delphi, when consulted, replied that the most learned man in Greece was Socrates.
Although Socrates was so wise and good and gentle, he was not at all conceited, and showed his wisdom by never pretending to know what he did not know, and by his readiness to learn anything new, provided one could prove it to be true.
Among the noted Athenians of this time was Aristophanes, a writer of comedies or funny plays. He was so witty that his comedies are still admired almost as much as when they were played in the Theater of Dionysus for the amusement of the people.
Like most funny men, Aristophanes liked to turn everything into ridicule. He had often seen Socrates and Alcibiades walking through the streets of Athens, and was greatly amused at the contrast they presented.
Now, Aristophanes, with all his cleverness, was not always just; and while his ridicule sometimes did good, at other times it did a great deal of harm. He soon learned to dislike Alcibiades; but he saw how dearly the people loved the young man, and fancied that his faults must be owing to the bad advice of his teacher. Such was not the case, for Socrates had tried to bring out all the good in his pupil. Alcibiades' pride, insolence, and treachery were rather the result of the constant flattery to which he had been exposed on the part of those who claimed to be his friends.
Aristophanes disliked Alcibiades so much that he soon wrote a comedy called ""The Clouds,"" in which he made fun of him. Of course, he did not call the people in the play by their real names; but the hero was a good-for-nothing young man, who, advised by his teacher, bought fast horses, ran his father into debt, cheated everybody, and treated even the gods with disrespect.
As the actors who took part in this comedy dressed and acted as nearly as possible like Alcibiades and Socrates, you can imagine that the play, which was very comical and clever, made the Athenians roar with laughter.
Everybody talked about it, repeated the best jokes, and went again and again to see and laugh over it. We are told that Socrates went there himself one day; and, when asked why he had come, he quietly said, ""I came to find out whether, among all the faults of which I am accused, there may not be some that I can correct.""
You see, the philosopher knew that it was never too late to mend, and fully intended to be as perfect as possible. He knew, of course, that he could not straighten his crooked nose or make his face good-looking, but he hoped to find some way of improving his character.
""The Clouds"" amused the Athenians for about twenty years; and when Alcibiades turned traitor, and caused the ruin of his country, the people still went to see it. In their anger against Alcibiades, they began to think that perhaps Aristophanes was right, and that the youth they had once loved so dearly would never have turned out so badly had he not been influenced by evil.
As the teacher in the play was blamed for all the wrongdoing of his pupil, Socrates was now accused by the Athenians of ruining Alcibiades. Little by little the philosopher's enemies became so bold that they finally made up their minds to get rid of him. As he was quite innocent, and as there was no other excuse for dragging him before the Tribunal, they finally charged him with giving bad advice to young men, and speaking ill of the gods.",Accusation of Socrates .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/8KcCarOb8K9edSThZ05bmQ/zfFcSGerRdaWo4veQarF8QVO-0xO9weTIv3M1EUW7Dmtt0ZDfF6I6AUCNLIKYtsm_VFuKt07iXSqAgfTJ77_3KhFJsfsyoBGrxNuDv6-6Ww/FG7LHDFCgp1jdONU_Clsioaa_hNKRavYyZgUFM1NJ9I),404
The Captain's Daughter,5,Poem,"We were crowded in the cabin,
Not a soul would dare to sleep,—
It was midnight on the waters,
And a storm was on the deep.

'Tis a fearful thing in winter
To be shattered by the blast,
And to hear the rattling trumpet
Thunder, ""Cut away the mast!""

So we shuddered there in silence,—
For the stoutest held his breath,
While the hungry sea was roaring
And the breakers talked with Death.

As thus we sat in darkness,
Each one busy with his prayers,
""We are lost!"" the captain shouted
As he staggered down the stairs.

But his little daughter whispered,
As she took his icy hand,
""Isn't God upon the ocean,
Just the same as on the land?""

Then we kissed the little maiden.
And we spoke in better cheer,
And we anchored safe in harbour
When the morn was shining clear.",The Captain's Daughter.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/FHong-cVauuvYVeKnBVA4A/iFYWzK_VqDLrGv87pBcsRSjYw8UAmkG__NyDlVeEJmNcu0Ix2c6h5sjKmi2iLcWJmRdgHLIg7IirgRO7EMrWYxWF9LyrYrVh8_14YbiPXCc/nwmpYiPrUi9uCm-us_tkENp8W_VPMT50ktMfzAgfGIE),405
Why Animals Should Not Be Held Captive,5,Informative Text,"Animals should not be held captive for a variety of reasons, including the fact that captivity can cause them physical and psychological harm, captivity is often detrimental to the conservation of wild populations, and that humans do not have the right to take animals from their natural habitats and keep them for our own entertainment or benefit.
Captivity can cause physical harm to animals in a number of ways. For example, animals in captivity are often kept in small, cramped spaces that do not allow them to move around freely or engage in natural behaviors. This can lead to health problems such as obesity, muscle atrophy, and joint problems. Additionally, captivity can also cause animals to develop abnormal behaviors such as repetitive pacing or self-mutilation.
Captivity can also cause psychological harm to animals. For example, many animals in captivity experience stress and anxiety as a result of being taken away from their natural habitats and social groups. This can lead to a range of behavioral problems, including aggression and depression. Additionally, many animals in captivity suffer from a lack of mental stimulation, which can lead to boredom and further psychological distress.
Another major issue with captivity is that it can be detrimental to the conservation of wild populations. Many animals in captivity are taken from the wild, which can lead to a decline in wild populations. Furthermore, animals in captivity are often bred for the purpose of being put on display, which can lead to genetic issues and inbreeding. This can also lead to the loss of genetic diversity which is crucial for the survival of wild populations.
Moreover, captivity also has a negative impact on the environment in which animals live. Captive animals are kept in artificial environments that are often not able to support the species' needs. This can lead to a number of ecological imbalances and can have negative effects on other animals living in the same ecosystem.
Finally, it is important to consider that humans do not have the right to take animals from their natural habitats and keep them for our own entertainment or benefit. Animals are sentient beings that have the right to live their lives in the wild, free from human interference. Keeping animals in captivity is a form of exploitation that should be avoided whenever possible.
In conclusion, there are many reasons why animals should not be held captive. Captivity can cause physical and psychological harm to animals, it can be detrimental to the conservation of wild populations, and it is a violation of the rights of animals to live their lives free from human interference. Therefore, it is important that we consider the welfare of animals and take steps to avoid keeping them in captivity whenever possible.",Why Animals Should Not Be Held Captive.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Mq9cUv5uSqS-EZvZ5KkANA/RhnRguOCv04fhydnaNi7Kst6kP4vVeAMqSni9UpQggpnMXQJUhRKgx7l38IFtqZ5CGrwrHqEtMHuudsQfqE-ilZB7Hyyhi5B1oGxmczpP3mD9TfMz52S6z4KBEgnlKM9/ot4LMuDbPjx4KWuYmkcJG0uFcC2cjZusnqJ0fkn6kAw),406
The Ice King,5,Short Story ,"Once upon a time there was an Indian village built on the bank of a wide river. During the spring, summer, and autumn the people were very happy. There was plenty of fuel and game in the deep woods; the river afforded excellent fish. But the Indians dreaded the months when the Ice King reigned.
One winter the weather was terribly cold and the people suffered severely. The Ice King called forth the keen wind from the northern sky, and piled the snowdrifts so high in the forests that it was most difficult to supply the wigwams with game. He covered the river with ice so thick that the Indians feared it would never melt.
""When will the Ice King leave us?"" they asked each other. ""We shall all perish if he continues his cruel reign.""
At last signs of spring encouraged the stricken people. The great snowdrifts in the forests disappeared and the ice on the river broke into large pieces. All of these floated downstream except one huge cake which lodged on the bank very near the village. And when the Indians saw that the spring sunshine did not melt this great mass of ice they were puzzled and anxious.
""It is the roof of the Ice King's lodge,"" they said. ""We shall never enjoy warm weather while he dwells near us. Have we no brave who is willing to do battle with this winter tyrant?""
At last, a courageous young hunter armed himself with a huge club and went forth to see if he could shatter the glittering frozen mass and rid the village of the giant who dwelt beneath it. With all his strength he struck the ice roof blow upon blow, crying out, ""Begone, O cruel Ice King! Your time is past! Begone!""
Finally, there was a deafening noise like the crashing of forest trees when the lightning struck, and the huge ice cake split into several pieces.
""Begone!"" cried the young brave, as he struggled with each great lump of ice until he pushed it from the bank and tumbled it into the river below.
And when the mighty task was finished the white figure of the Ice King stood before the Indian brave.
""You have ruined my lodge,"" said the giant.
""The winter season is past,"" answered the brave. ""Begone!""
""After several moons I shall return to stay,"" threatened the Ice King. Then he stalked away toward the North.
The people were very happy when they knew that the young brave had conquered the giant; but their joy was somewhat dampened when they heard about the threatened return of the Ice King.
""I shall prepare for his return and do battle with him again,"" declared the Indian conqueror.
This promise comforted the people somewhat, but still they thought of the coming winter with dread.
During the autumn the hunter built near the river a strong wigwam and stored therein abundant fuel and dried game. He filled many bags made of skin, with oil, which he procured from the animals he killed. Also, he was well supplied with fur rugs, blankets, and warm clothes.
At last the winter season came. The cold north wind blew unceasingly, the snow piled high around the wigwams; ice several feet thick covered the river.
""The Ice King has come,"" said the Indians. ""If he keeps his threat to stay among us we shall surely perish.""
One bitter cold day the young Indian who had prepared well for the severe weather sat in his wigwam near a blazing fire. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind tore aside the bear skin which protected the doorway and into the lodge stalked the Ice King. His freezing breath filled the place and dampened the fire. He took a seat opposite the Indian brave who said, ""Welcome, Ice King.""
""I've come to stay,"" answered the giant.
The Indian shivered with cold at the sudden change of temperature in his wigwam, but he rose and brought more logs to the fire. Also, he opened one of his bags of oil and poured the contents on the great pieces of wood. The flames soon caught the oil-soaked logs and a roaring fire crackled and blazed in the wigwam. More and more fuel the young brave piled on his fire until finally the frosty cold air was changed to summer heat.
The Ice King shifted his seat away from the glowing fire. Farther and farther away he pushed until he sat with his back against the wall of the wigwam. As he moved he seemed to grow smaller and weaker. The icy feathers of his headgear drooped about his forehead and great drops of sweat covered his face. But still the Indian brave piled fuel on the blazing fire.
""Spare me, O hunter,"" cried the Ice King.
But to the words of the giant the young Indian was deaf. He opened another bag of oil and poured it on the logs.
""Have mercy, I beg you!"" pleaded the Ice King. He rose and staggered toward the door.
""You have conquered me,"" he said in a weak voice. ""I will depart. Twice you have won a victory over me. I give up my hope of reigning continually among your people. My season shall last for three moons, only.""
He staggered out of the wigwam and stalked wearily away. Since that day the giant Ice King has not tried to reign throughout the year.",The Ice King.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/fjYbibCnrqbjvjL4_-KKGQ/RUaDZ2ed2oYjO5HoXwqxoOZ4COGBEMfflYPR79xISStVxEXFRkrBQhUrTav1NeVhkaNp0y-vugSJx9M5FgeIhh-FNdOrxiOuPZJ0GpffSXI/gWDtHSpL36xovuKdFSSkYkVE4NMSdqZQnYWPyygJilU),407
Song of Life,5,Poem,"A traveller on a dusty road
Strewed acorns on the lea;
And one took root and sprouted up,
And grew into a tree.
Love sought its shade at evening-time,
To breathe its early vows;
And Age was pleased, in heights of noon,
To bask beneath its boughs.
The dormouse loved its dangling twigs,
The birds sweet music bore—
It stood a glory in its place,
A blessing evermore.

A little spring had lost its way
Amid the grass and fern;
A passing stranger scooped a well
Where weary men might turn.
He walled it in, and hung with care
A ladle on the brink;
He thought not of the deed he did,
But judged that Toil might drink.
He passed again; and lo! the well,
By summer never dried,
Had cooled ten thousand parchéd tongues,
And saved a life beside.

A nameless man, amid the crowd
That thronged the daily mart,
Let fall a word of hope and love,
Unstudied from the heart,
A whisper on the tumult thrown,
A transitory breath,
It raised a brother from the dust,
It saved a soul from death.
O germ! O fount! O word of love!
O thought at random cast!
Ye were but little at the first,
But mighty at the last.",Song of Life .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/G2V7Ej2OLXhlV0EUvcphjA/p0MAec_URfFF0fAuzujdg_safQoL_h0Onn0aM8oqdpCxf_s66dGc4q7vxDPxA04o-S8FpDPj352gv7fvQVCmeibhsQHOv61DEcQvJHK0Q9Y/gblf7DcMqf0iF1VnoKdaaN4ASG6lRKgI6hBJoBkfWPo),408
Is There Life on Mars?,5,Informative Text,"Scientists have been studying the possibility of life on Mars for many years. Mars is a planet that is similar to Earth in many ways. It is about the same size as Earth and has a similar rotation period, meaning that a day on Mars is about the same length as a day on Earth. Mars also has a thin atmosphere and polar ice caps.
One of the main reasons scientists believe that there may be life on Mars is because of the presence of water. Water is essential for life as we know it, and scientists have found evidence of water on Mars. This includes the presence of ice at the poles and in soil samples, as well as the discovery of a liquid water lake beneath the planet's surface.
Another reason scientists believe that there may be life on Mars is because of the presence of methane. Methane is a gas that is produced by living organisms on Earth. In 2013, scientists detected a spike in methane levels on Mars, which led to speculation that there may be microbial life on the planet.
However, it's important to note that there is no conclusive evidence of life on Mars yet. While the presence of water and methane are promising signs, they could also be the result of non-biological processes. Additionally, the harsh conditions on Mars, including extreme cold and radiation, make it difficult for life as we know it to survive.
Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, scientists continue to study Mars in the hopes of finding life. NASA's Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars in 2020, is currently searching for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover is also collecting rock and soil samples that will be returned to Earth for further study.
In addition to NASA, many other space agencies and private companies are also planning missions to Mars in the future. These missions will continue to search for evidence of life on the planet, and will also help to pave the way for future human exploration of Mars.
In conclusion, while there is currently no conclusive evidence of life on Mars, scientists believe that it is possible due to the presence of water and methane on the planet. Further research and exploration of Mars will help us to better understand the potential for life on the red planet.",Is There Life on Mars.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/SN2BNL86CckeZ5JjYkPMGA/oE1zbiSNG5QSvWzOGcNZKG4WtNwK31kCIRXilOLxi-4YRD3qqQ26hb1FFaJfEQTIwJih3JDiTUZWE63A0qORvpf9FlHvVPiryLIJt66pQp0/AxuCf_HGB_LArnqkLlYaP4OFuRAy2yM09YFqrOVr4xk),409
Advice from a Caterpillar,5,Short Story ,"At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice.
""Who are you?"" said the Caterpillar.
Alice replied, rather shyly, ""I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have changed several times since then.""
""What do you mean by that?"" said the Caterpillar, sternly. ""Explain yourself!""
""I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir,"" said Alice, ""because I'm not myself, you see—being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing."" She drew herself up and said very gravely, ""I think you ought to tell me who you are, first.""
""Why?"" said the Caterpillar.
As Alice could not think of any good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
""Come back!"" the Caterpillar called after her. ""I've something important to say!"" Alice turned and came back again.
""Keep your temper,"" said the Caterpillar.
""Is that all?"" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
""No,"" said the Caterpillar.
It unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ""So you think you're changed, do you?""
""I'm afraid, I am, sir,"" said Alice. ""I can't remember things as I used to—and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!""
""What size do you want to be?"" asked the Caterpillar.
""Oh, I'm not particular as to size,"" Alice hastily replied, ""only one doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,"" said Alice. ""Three inches is such a wretched height to be.""
""It is a very good height indeed!"" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, ""One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.""
""One side of what? The other side of what?"" thought Alice to herself.
""Of the mushroom,"" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
""And now which is which?"" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin—it had struck her foot!
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bits. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....
""Come, my head's free at last!"" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
""Where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?"" She was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry—a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings.
""Serpent!"" cried the Pigeon.
""I'm not a serpent!"" said Alice indignantly. ""Let me alone!""
""I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,"" the Pigeon went on, ""but those serpents! There's no pleasing them!""
Alice was more and more puzzled.
""As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,"" said the Pigeon, ""but I must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,"" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, ""and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must need to come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!""
""But I'm not a serpent, I tell you!"" said Alice. ""I'm a—I'm a—I'm a little girl,"" she added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
""You're looking for eggs, I know that well enough,"" said the Pigeon; ""and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?""
""It matters a good deal to me,"" said Alice hastily; ""but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want yours—I don't like them raw.""
""Well, be off, then!"" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first. ""The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?"" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. ""Whoever lives there,"" thought Alice, ""it'll never do to come upon them this size; why, I should frighten them out of their wits!"" She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",Advice from a Caterpillar.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/RBbX0CLqQahyWhLHdIGO7g/JpKKublO1vWzgb9bY8FY2TkNZuEO-ol9OdpVA9dKahh-AM30ognZSPG7mAKd9NsMbnXJbCkoLb65k-eOMJNLP6TIBV_nho6J-BT2TTaNInOqhBpTZoG3Y2MYs69HFfQy/b0OCTpf0gTg7udclYjgE7pnaiTsgM6YNFJmpdmBdiiw),410

Why Should You Participate in Curricular Activities in School?,5,Informative Text,"Participating in curricular activities in school is essential for the overall development of students. It not only helps students to excel academically but also allows them to discover and develop their talents, interests, and passions. It also provides them with opportunities to learn important life skills and make meaningful connections with their peers and community.
Academically, curricular activities can help students to improve their grades, test scores, and overall academic performance. For example, students who participate in music programs tend to score higher on math and reading tests than those who do not. Additionally, students involved in sports or debate teams often develop strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are crucial for academic success.
Curricular activities also allow students to discover and develop their talents, interests, and passions. Many students have a hidden talent or passion that they may not have discovered without the opportunity to participate in activities such as drama, photography, or robotics. These activities can also provide students with a sense of purpose and motivation, which can lead to a more positive attitude towards school and learning.
Participating in curricular activities also teaches students important life skills such as time management, teamwork, and leadership. For example, students who participate in sports learn how to work as a team, set goals, and overcome challenges. Similarly, students involved in drama or debate teams learn how to communicate effectively and present themselves in front of others.

Lady White and Lady Yellow,5,Short Story ,"Long ago there grew in a meadow a white and yellow chrysanthemums side by side in a meadow. One day an old gardener chanced to come across them and he took a great fancy to Lady Yellow. He told her that if she would come along with him he would make her far more attractive; that he would give her delicate food and fine clothes to wear.
Lady Yellow was so charmed with what the old man said, that she forgot all about the white sister and consented to be lifted up, carried in the arms of the old gardener and to be placed in his garden.
When Lady Yellow and her master had departed, Lady White wept bitterly. Her own simple beauty had been despised; but, what was far worse, she was forced to remain in the meadow alone, without the companionship of her sister, to whom she had been devoted.
Day by day Lady Yellow grew more fair in her master's garden. No one would have recognized the common flower of the field, but though her petals were long and curled and her leaves so clean and well cared for, she sometimes thought of Lady White alone in the field, and wondered how she managed to make the long and lonely hours pass by.
One day a village chief came to the old man's garden in quest of a perfect chrysanthemum that he might take to his lord for a crest design. He informed the old man that he did not want a fine chrysanthemum with long petals. What he wanted was a simple white chrysanthemum with sixteen petals. The old man told the village chief to see Lady Yellow, but this flower did not please him, and, thanking the gardener, he took his departure.
On his way home he happened to enter a field when he saw Lady White weeping. She told him the sad story of her loneliness, and when she had finished her tale of woe the village chief informed her that he had seen Lady Yellow and did not consider her half so beautiful as her own white self. At these cheery words Lady White dried her eyes and she nearly jumped off her little feet when this kind man told her that he wanted her for his lord's crest!
In another happy moment the happy Lady White was being carried in a palanquin. When she reached the Daimyo's palace all warmly praised her perfection of form. Great artists came from far and near, set about her and sketched the flower with wonderful skill. She soon saw her pretty white face on all of Daimyo's most precious belongings. She saw it on his armor and lacquer boxes, on his quilts and cushions and robes. She was painted floating down a stream and in all manner of quaint and beautiful ways. Everyone acknowledged that the white chrysanthemum with her sixteen petals made the most wonderful crest in all of Japan. While Lady White's happy face lived forever designed upon the Daimyo's possessions, Lady Yellow met with a sad fate. She had bloomed for herself alone and had drunk in the visitor's praise as eagerly as she did the dew upon her finely curled petals. One day, however, she felt a stiffness in her limbs and a cessation of the exuberance of life. Her once proud head fell forward, and when the old man found her he pulled her up and tossed her upon a rubbish heap.",Lady White and Lady Yellow.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/1R6JDKBmBUXsvpVJhy8CfA/tJ8TF6R_mfCSuCA6F16WO915tEh8zbJo7sePw5kboPn2AjtuPbK2L7qxGbtJHmNHwvdHQWcq_LMlornvY_JPr_X9UmKkKFw45YSKy20QC4QEDGJy062mnXzOta583Ihm/Jh2AkragPDkqv3v8A_gs0R4LoqRDbmSlqafyOYp_W4Y),413
Against Getting Angry,5,Poem,"Whatever brawls disturb the street,
There should be peace at home;
Where sisters dwell and brothers meet,
Quarrels should never come.

Birds in their little nests agree,
And 'tis a shameful sight,
When children of one family
Fall out, and chide, and fight.

Hard names at first, and threatening words,
Which are but noisy breath,
May grow to clubs and naked swords;
To murder, and to death.

The devil tempts one mother's son
To rage against another;
So wicked Cain was hurried on
Till he had killed his brother.

The wise will make their anger cool,
At least, before 'tis night;
But in the bosom of a fool
It burns till morning light.

Pardon, O Lord, our childish rage,
Our little brawls remove;
That, as we grow to riper age,
Our hearts may all be love.",Against Getting Angry.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/HLol_85th5ixvqH2a7Fz7g/orBnKYJT75vws1o-cxTMk6it-D784N7yMqCQVY74QTcqrmrKULsLaNqIP1UD9N35arMJXKu5Js-m8_o2InylTarhAa6QIpVyvArBRK4NnMM/NmOzTnYSUPNv5u5Gxr--IyDzrcjeUxvtcJ6k_74z7Vw),414
Does History Teach Us Anything?,5,Informative Text,"The question of whether or not history teaches us anything is a complex and multi-faceted one. On the one hand, it is clear that studying history allows us to understand the past and the context in which events occurred. It also helps us to gain a deeper understanding of the present and the forces that shape our world. On the other hand, there are those who argue that history is simply a collection of facts and events that have little relevance to our current lives.
One of the key arguments for the importance of studying history is that it allows us to understand the context in which events occurred. Without an understanding of the past, it is difficult to fully grasp the present. For example, if we do not understand the causes of World War II, we will not be able to fully understand the political and social landscape of today's Europe. Similarly, if we do not understand the history of colonialism and imperialism, we will not be able to fully understand the current state of the world.
Another important aspect of studying history is that it allows us to gain a deeper understanding of human nature. Throughout history, we see patterns of human behavior that are repeated over and over again. By studying these patterns, we can gain insight into why people behave the way they do and what motivates them. This understanding can be incredibly valuable in our personal and professional lives, as it allows us to better understand and communicate with others.
Despite these benefits, there are some who argue that studying history is a waste of time. They argue that history is simply a collection of facts and events that have little relevance to our current lives. They may also argue that the past is not a reliable guide to the future and that we should focus on the present and the future.
However, this argument is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the past does not always repeat itself, there are certain patterns and trends that do repeat themselves. For example, the rise and fall of empires is a recurring theme throughout history. By studying these patterns, we can gain insight into how and why they occurred and use this knowledge to make more informed decisions in the present.
Furthermore, it is important to remember that history is not just a collection of facts and events, but it also includes the perspectives, biases and interpretations of the historian. It is an essential tool to understand how and why different societies and cultures have developed and evolved over time. It also helps to understand the different perspectives and biases of the people and groups that are studied.
In conclusion, studying history can be incredibly valuable. It allows us to understand the context in which events occurred, gain a deeper understanding of human nature, and make more informed decisions in the present. While it is true that the past does not always repeat itself, there are certain patterns and trends that do repeat themselves, and by studying these patterns, we can gain insight into how and why they occurred and use this knowledge to make more informed decisions in the present.

King Lear,5,Short Story ,"King Lear was old and tired. He was aweary of the business of his kingdom, and wished only to end his days quietly near his three daughters. Two of his daughters were married to the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall; and the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France were both suitors for the hand of Cordelia, his youngest daughter.
Lear called his three daughters together, and told them that he proposed to divide his kingdom between them. “But first,” he said, “I should like to know much you love me.”
Goneril, who was really a very wicked woman, and did not love her father at all, said she loved him more than words could say; she loved him dearer than eyesight, space or liberty, more than life, grace, health, beauty, and honor.
“I love you as much as my sister and more,” professed Regan, “since I care for nothing but my father's love.”
Lear was very much pleased with Regan's professions, and turned to his youngest daughter, Cordelia. “Now, our joy, though last not least,” he said, “the best part of my kingdom have I kept for you. What can you say?”
“Nothing, my lord,” answered Cordelia.
“Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again,” said the King.
And Cordelia answered, “I love your Majesty according to my duty--no more, no less.”
And this she said, because she was disgusted with the way in which her sisters professed love, when really they had not even a right sense of duty to their old father.
“I am your daughter,” she went on, “and you have brought me up and loved me, and I return you those duties back as are right and fit, obey you, love you, and most honor you.”
Lear, who loved Cordelia best, had wished her to make more extravagant professions of love than her sisters. “Go,” he said, “be for ever a stranger to my heart and me.”
The Earl of Kent, one of Lear's favorite courtiers and captains, tried to say a word for Cordelia's sake, but Lear would not listen. He divided the kingdom between Goneril and Regan, and told them that he should only keep a hundred knights at arms, and would live with his daughters by turns.
When the Duke of Burgundy knew that Cordelia would have no share of the kingdom, he gave up his courtship of her. But the King of France was wiser, and said, “Thy dowerless daughter, King, is Queen of us--of ours, and our fair France.”
“Take her, take her,” said the King; “for I will never see that face of hers again.”
So Cordelia became Queen of France, and the Earl of Kent, for having ventured to take her part, was banished from the kingdom. The King now went to stay with his daughter Goneril, who had got everything from her father that he had to give, and now began to grudge even the hundred knights that he had reserved for himself. She was harsh and undutiful to him, and her servants either refused to obey his orders or pretended that they did not hear them.
Now the Earl of Kent, when he was banished, made as though he would go into another country, but instead he came back in the disguise of a servingman and took service with the King. The King had now two friends--the Earl of Kent, whom he only knew as his servant, and his Fool, who was faithful to him. Goneril told her father plainly that his knights only served to fill her Court with riot and feasting; and so she begged him only to keep a few old men about him such as himself.
“My train are men who know all parts of duty,” said Lear. “Goneril, I will not trouble you further--yet I have left another daughter.”
And his horses being saddled, he set out with his followers for the castle of Regan. But she, who had formerly outdone her sister in professions of attachment to the King, now seemed to outdo her in undutiful conduct, saying that fifty knights were too many to wait on him, and Goneril (who had hurried thither to prevent Regan showing any kindness to the old King) said five were too many, since her servants could wait on him.
Then when Lear saw that what they really wanted was to drive him away, he left them. It was a wild and stormy night, and he wandered about the heath half mad with misery, and with no companion but the poor Fool. But presently his servant, the good Earl of Kent, met him, and at last persuaded him to lie down in a wretched little hovel. At daybreak the Earl of Kent removed his royal master to Dover, and hurried to the Court of France to tell Cordelia what had happened.
Cordelia's husband gave her an army and with it she landed at Dover. Here she found poor King Lear, wandering about the fields, wearing a crown of nettles and weeds. They brought him back and fed and clothed him, and Cordelia came to him and kissed him.
“You must bear with me,” said Lear; “forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.”
And now he knew at last which of his children it was that had loved him best, and who was worthy of his love.
Goneril and Regan joined their armies to fight Cordelia's army, and were successful; and Cordelia and her father were thrown into prison. Then Goneril's husband, the Duke of Albany, who was a good man, and had not known how wicked his wife was, heard the truth of the whole story; and when Goneril found that her husband knew her for the wicked woman she was, she killed herself, having a little time before given a deadly poison to her sister, Regan, out of a spirit of jealousy.
But they had arranged that Cordelia should be hanged in prison, and though the Duke of Albany sent messengers at once, it was too late. The old King came staggering into the tent of the Duke of Albany, carrying the body of his dear daughter Cordelia, in his arms.
And soon after, with words of love for her upon his lips, he fell with her still in his arms, and died.",King Lear.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/ux5XoChQe7cy2t46wkMaNA/3k6qerMVhN7ik3_f8zebTKeQtEYtQRH8ykUZ2EGjans_VdXhJAblBW19uLdBY-NWAGtUmvRymdz3dDvUjq2gIrtZ7jDTPY5poRAK3q8yxAw/RqR_9AWqAbWwPJ96KZmgepx7aUvuIbR9WDo21SRQTkw),416

A Child's Dream of a Star,5,Short Story ,"There was once a child, and he strolled about a good deal, and thought of a number of things. He had a sister, who was a child too, and his constant companion. These two used to wander all day long. They wondered at the beauty of the flowers; they wondered at the height and blueness of the sky; they wondered at the depth of the bright water; they wondered at the goodness and the power of God who made the lovely world.
They used to say to one another, sometimes, supposing all the children upon earth were to die, would the flowers, and the water, and the sky be sorry? They believed they would be sorry. For, said they, the buds are the children of the flowers, and the little playful streams that gambol down the hill-sides are the children of the water; and the smallest bright specks playing at hide and seek in the sky all night, must surely be the children of the stars; and they would all be grieved to see their playmates, the children of men, no more.
There was one clear shining star that used to come out in the sky before the rest, near the church spire, above the graves. It was larger and more beautiful, they thought, than all the others, and every night they watched for it, standing hand in hand at a window. Whoever saw it first cried out, ""I see the star!"" And often they cried out both together, knowing so well when it would rise, and where. So they grew to be such friends with it, that, before lying down in their beds, they always looked out once again, to bid it good-night; and when they were turning round to sleep, they used to say, ""God bless the star!""
But while she was still very young, oh very, very young, the sister drooped, and came to be so weak that she could no longer stand in the window at night; and then the child looked sadly out by himself, and when he saw the star, turned round and said to the patient pale face on the bed, ""I see the star!"" and then a smile would come upon the face, and a little weak voice used to say, ""God bless my brother and the star!""
And so the time came all too soon! when the child looked out alone, and when there was no face on the bed; and when there was a little grave among the graves, not there before; and when the star made long rays down toward him, as he saw it through his tears.
Now, these rays were so bright, and they seemed to make such a shining way from earth to Heaven, that when the child went to his solitary bed, he dreamed about the star; and dreamed that, lying where he was, he saw a train of people taken up that sparkling road by angels. And the star, opening, showed him a great world of light, where many more such angels waited to receive them.
All these angels, who were waiting, turned their beaming eyes upon the people who were carried up into the star; and some came out from the long rows in which they stood, and fell upon the people's necks, and kissed them tenderly, and went away with them down avenues of light, and were so happy in their company, that lying in his bed he wept for joy.
But, there were many angels who did not go with them, and among them one he knew. The patient face that once had lain upon the bed was glorified and radiant, but his heart found out his sister among all the hosts.
His sister's angel lingered near the entrance of the star, and said to the leader among those who had brought the people thither:
""Is my brother coming?""
And he said ""No.""
She was turning hopefully away, when the child stretched out his arms, and cried, ""O, sister, I am here! Take me!"" and then she turned her beaming eyes upon him, and it was night; and the star was shining into the room, making long rays down towards him as he saw it through his tears.
From that hour forth, the child looked out upon the star as on the home he was to go to, when his time should come; and he thought that he did not belong to the earth alone, but to the star too, because of his sister's angel gone before.
There was a baby born to be a brother to the child; and while he was so little that he never yet had spoken word he stretched his tiny form out on his bed, and died.
Again the child dreamed of the open star, and of the company of angels, and the train of people, and the rows of angels with their beaming eyes all turned upon those people's faces.
Said his sister's angel to the leader:
""Is my brother coming?""
And he said ""Not that one, but another.""
As the child beheld his brother's angel in her arms, he cried, ""O, sister, I am here! Take me!"" And she turned and smiled upon him, and the star was shining.
He grew to be a young man, and was busy at his books when an old servant came to him and said:
""Thy mother is no more. I bring her blessing on her darling son!""
Again at night he saw the star, and all that former company. Said his sister's angel to the leader:
""Is my brother coming?""
And he said, ""Thy mother!""
A mighty cry of joy went forth through all the stars, because the mother was reunited with her two children. And he stretched out his arms and cried, ""O, mother, sister, and brother, I am here! Take me!"" And they answered him, ""Not yet,"" and the star was shining.
He grew to be a man, whose hair was turning gray, and he was sitting in his chair by the fireside, heavy with grief, and with his face bedewed with tears, when the star opened once again.
Said his sister's angel to the leader: ""Is my brother coming?""
And he said, ""Nay, but his maiden daughter.""
And the man who had been the child saw his daughter, newly lost to him, a celestial creature among those three, and he said, ""My daughter's head is on my sister's bosom, and her arm is around my mother's neck, and at her feet there is the baby of old time, and I can bear the parting from her, God be praised!""
And the star was shining.
Thus the child came to be an old man, and his once smooth face was wrinkled, and his steps were slow and feeble, and his back was bent. And one night as he lay upon his bed, his children standing round, he cried, as he had cried so long ago:
""I see the star!""
They whispered one to another, ""He is dying.""
And he said, ""I am. My age is falling from me like a garment, and I move towards the star as a child. And O, my Father, now I thank Thee that it has so often opened, to receive those dear ones who await me!""
And the star was shining, and it shines upon his grave.",A Child's Dream of a Star.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/xyt0FoQOcUK02tmnGXC__A/VW58ndbpr0FQnJVD2rFx2825thfubdbiXTJMy75sADD8wAzXNyfTbHkCGd1JHR3it1K2gj2CQAE-asPP4iH1XKJL_04r1TL7qsd1ZMSlCeU/_NX-6YYNJgtErKtcYo4FUVYtduRQQDpH1J6ZkeJdbAs),419
An Old Song of Fairies,5,Poem,"Come, follow, follow me,
You, fairy elves that be:
Which circle on the greene,
Come, follow Mab your queene.
Hand in hand let's dance around,
For this place is fairye ground.

When mortals are at rest,
And snoring in their nest:
Unheard, and unespy'd,
Through key-holes we do glide;
Over tables, stools, and shelves,
We trip it with our fairy elves.

And, if the house be foul
With platter, dish, or bowl,
Up stairs we nimbly creep,
And find the sluts asleep:
There we pinch their armes and thighes;
None escapes, nor none espies.

But if the house be swept,
And from uncleanness kept,
We praise the household maid,
And duely she is paid:
For we use before we goe
To drop a tester in her shoe.

Upon a mushroomes head
Our table-cloth we spread;
A grain of rye, or wheat,
Is manchet, which we eat;
Pearly drops of dew we drink
In acorn cups fill'd to the brink.

The brains of nightingales,
With unctuous fat of snailes,
Between two cockles stew'd,
Is meat that's easily chew'd;
Tailes of wormes, and marrow of mice,
Do make a dish, that's wonderous nice.

The grashopper, gnat, and fly,
Serve for our minstrelsie;
Grace said, we dance a while,
And so the time beguile:
And if the moon doth hide her head,
The gloe-worm lights us home to bed.

On tops of dewie grasse
So nimbly do we passe,
The young and tender stalk
Ne'er bends when we do walk:
Yet in the morning may be seen
Where we the night before have been.",An Old Song of Fairies.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/3PWxLkO7zp3eWHVlvewbXw/eieLMgSKMv7Z20zHLwiLn_z0OUtZdaxOKusQLjCLR8NJCenhxa586tSy0zg5kXUF4Onnxyz-9MuLbaIc_PyYuggafEqNiqMFLXG3jxuHdwU/Zij3P5lQMxUwSQStTXmropDLLqYwtT8GUpajlAqlw0o),420
The Difference between Traditional and Virtual Schools,5,Informative Text,"Traditional schools and virtual schools are two different ways of delivering education to students. Both have their own unique set of advantages and disadvantages.
Traditional schools are brick-and-mortar institutions where students physically attend classes and interact with teachers and classmates in person. These schools offer a structured and well-defined learning environment, with set schedules, curriculum, and standardized assessments. 
In addition, traditional schools often provide a wide range of extracurricular activities, sports teams, and clubs that can foster a sense of community and belonging among students.
On the other hand, virtual schools, also known as online schools, are educational institutions that deliver instruction and curriculum entirely online. These schools allow students to learn at their own pace, in their own time, and from their own location. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules, live in remote areas, or have medical conditions that prevent them from attending traditional schools. 
Virtual schools also offer a wide range of courses and programs, including Advanced Placement and college-level courses, that may not be available at traditional schools.
However, virtual schools also have their own set of disadvantages. Virtual schools can be less social, as students may not have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers in person. This can make it harder for students to form relationships and connections with others, which can be important for their overall well-being. 
Virtual schools also tend to have less structure, which can make it harder for some students to stay motivated and focused on their studies.
In terms of academic performance, studies have shown that students in virtual schools tend to perform similarly to those in traditional schools, however, there are concerns that students in virtual schools may have lower rates of graduation and college acceptance.
In conclusion, traditional schools and virtual schools are two different ways of delivering education to students, each with their own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Traditional schools offer a structured and well-defined learning environment, with set schedules, curriculum, and standardized assessments, while virtual schools offer flexibility and a wide range of courses and programs. 
Ultimately, the choice between traditional and virtual schools will depend on the individual needs and preferences of the student and their family.",The Difference between Traditional and Virtual Schools.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/GR9l9TwI_S5fHt7VIJcPfA/rFvTcXpDMRqMemGK52nFfKrktMWBW9P39PrzIzK8JfKPfFJL5WtnyrtsBVYaVZROWqToOiYuQ76uDmPDMY3_g6etgfweP6M2ecLfYd10_Ths_Dy1TruhFFd04WSR9i29Y6t9MT6ZXUr44AKCI0NQ4A/o-D1qX4VOzlhwttCtE9DPVEmdb_07nYb3KlGYesr4lg),421
Old Sultan,5,Short Story ,"There was once a peasant who owned a faithful dog called Sultan, now grown so old that he had lost all his teeth, and could lay hold of nothing. One day the man was standing at the door of his house with his wife, and he said,
""I shall kill the old Sultan to-morrow; he is of no good any longer.""
His wife felt sorry for the poor dog, and answered, ""He has served us for so many years, and has kept with us so faithfully, he deserves food and shelter in his old age.""
""Dear me, you do not seem to understand the matter,"" said the husband; ""he has never a tooth, and no thief would mind him in the least, so I do not see why he should not be made away with. If he has served us well, we have given him plenty of good food.""
The poor dog, who was lying stretched out in the sun not far off, heard all they said, and was very sad to think that the next day would be his last. He bethought him of his great friend the wolf, and slipped out in the evening to the wood to see him, and related to him the fate that was awaiting him.
""Listen to me, old fellow,"" said the wolf; ""be of good courage, I will help you in your need. I have thought of a way. Early to-morrow morning your master is going hay-making with his wife, and they will take their child with them, so that no one will be left at home. They will be sure to lay the child in the shade behind the hedge while they are at work; you must lie by its side, just as if you were watching it. Then I will come out of the wood and steal away the child; you must rush after me, as if to save it from me. Then I must let it fall, and you must bring it back again to its parents, who will think that you have saved it, and will be much too grateful to do you any harm; on the contrary, you will be received into full favor, and they will never let you want for anything again.""
The dog was pleased with the plan, which was carried out accordingly. When the father saw the wolf running away with his child he cried out, and when old Sultan brought it back again, he was much pleased with him, and patted him, saying,
""Not a hair of him shall be touched; he shall have food and shelter as long as he lives."" And he said to his wife,
""Go home directly and make some good stew for old Sultan, something that does not need biting; and get the pillow from my bed for him to lie on.""
From that time old Sultan was made so comfortable that he had nothing left to wish for. Before long the wolf paid him a visit, to congratulate him that all had gone so well.
""But, old fellow,"" said he, ""you must wink at my making off by chance with a fat sheep of your master's; perhaps one will escape some fine day.""
""Don't reckon on that,"" answered the dog; ""I cannot consent to it; I must remain true to my master.""
But the wolf, not supposing it was said in earnest, came sneaking in the night to carry off the sheep. But the master, who had been warned by the faithful Sultan of the wolf's intention, was waiting for him, and gave him a fine hiding with the threshing-flail. So the wolf had to make his escape, calling out to the dog,
""You shall pay for this, you traitor!""
The next morning the wolf sent the wild boar to call out the dog; and to appoint a meeting in the woods to receive satisfaction from him. Old Sultan could find no second but a cat with three legs; and as they set off together, the poor thing went limping along, holding her tail up in the air. The wolf and his second were already on the spot; when they saw their antagonists coming, and caught sight of the elevated tail of the cat, they thought it was a sabre they were bringing with them. And as the poor thing came limping on three legs, they supposed it was lifting a big stone to throw at them. This frightened them very much; the wild boar crept among the leaves, and the wolf clambered up into a tree. And when the dog and cat came up, they were surprised not to see anyone there. However, the wild boar was not perfectly hidden in the leaves, and the tips of his ears peeped out. And when the cat caught sight of one, she thought it was a mouse, and sprang upon it, seizing it with her teeth. Out leaped the wild boar with a dreadful cry, and ran away shouting,
""There is the culprit in the tree!""
And the dog and the cat looking up caught sight of the wolf, who came down, quite ashamed of his timidity, and made peace with the dog once more.",Old Sultan.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/C2BCzvUGkEftA6T0eeKl_w/dSnjHWVJW6qUpJNobVe86wB6shlXDdY-xx9yN-0ODo8oLJ8pTWyM2qHzOuw8NguDAiduF-1yDHqWB0o1KYgBBzKGgJ9FC0jZyR35PlOJ52s/8Zd005wLVwSjrIE7EOmKeL_f39ABcjH-3SmJv56IVQg),422
The Sea Princess,5,Poem,"In a palace of pearl and seaweed,
Set around with shining shells,
Under the deeps of the ocean,
The little sea princess dwells.

Sometimes she sees the shadow
Of a great whale passing by,
Or a white-winged vessel sailing
Between the sea and sky.

And when through the waves she rises,
Beyond the breakers' roar
She hears the shouts of the children
At play on the sandy shore;

And sees the ships' sides tower
Above like a wet black wall;
Or shouts to the roaring breakers,
And answers the sea gull's call.

But down in the quiet waters
Better she loves to play,
Making a seaweed garden,
Purple and green and gray;

Stringing with pearls a necklace,
Or learning curious spells
From the water witch, gray and ancient,
And hearing the tales she tells.

Out in the stable her sea horse
Champs in his crystal stall,
And fishes with scales that glisten
Come leaping forth at her call.

So the little princess
Is busy and happy all day
Just as the human children
Are busy and happy at play.

And when the darkness gathers
Over the lonely deep,
On a bed of velvet seaweed
The princess is rocked to sleep.",The Sea Princess.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/tC4pnSuyfAGXixPZGfPs6A/i8hjDl83d_mhtxOILgFu59UuhZ2I088TbX2dMCxSGEhNin851Ee9zpvBr5t0tqIqmOLxhEq6Fz7wTmtsiCrf_dtaqmNIU02DCd43DNCyrnc/gY3cZQuABc0xd_9OHzpHabt5J6Y0GmtKweYzHOvXkKI),423
Who Discovered America?,5,Informative Text,"It is widely accepted that the indigenous peoples of the Americas were the first to discover and inhabit the land now known as America. However, the question of who ""discovered"" America is a complex and controversial topic with multiple perspectives.
From a European perspective, the credit for the discovery of America is often given to Christopher Columbus, who set sail in 1492 with the goal of finding a new route to Asia. Instead, he landed on an island in the Caribbean, which he initially believed to be part of Asia. Columbus made several more voyages to the Caribbean and Central and South America, claiming the land for Spain.
However, it is important to note that Columbus was not the first European to reach America. Leif Erikson, a Norse explorer, is believed to have reached North America around 1000 AD, more than 400 years before Columbus. Additionally, other explorers such as Giovanni Caboto, also known as John Cabot, and Vasco Núñez de Balboa reached America before Columbus.
It is also important to recognize the perspectives and contributions of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. For thousands of years, these groups had already established complex societies and cultures on the land that would come to be known as America. They had their own systems of discovery and exploration, and had developed advanced technologies, agriculture, and trade networks.
The arrival of European explorers had a significant and lasting impact on the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The introduction of European diseases, as well as violence, exploitation, and forced removal of indigenous peoples, decimated their populations and disrupted their cultures.
In conclusion, the discovery of America is a complex and multi-faceted topic with multiple perspectives. While Christopher Columbus is often credited with the discovery of America from a European perspective, it is important to recognize the contributions and perspectives of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, as well as the other European explorers who reached America before him. The arrival of Europeans had a devastating impact on the indigenous peoples, and it is important to acknowledge and remember this history.",Who Discovered America.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/nkOVuU6KSbx4RU3U5Xf6FQ/RSTKOwYSo_-hxi93sctZ4ZmryUW1acwHW969dF6Gkra-NTKPMNKzOBGMXNNPc0Y3H1m9JWhvac7ySChz-Kqxo5JjqF8IvsDdvfPDnFzoJeU/P11lx63by5DWSAX8m1SfXVlJewHznFGPtRx5kEFBAMk),424
The White Snake,5,Short Story ,"Long time ago there lived a King whose wisdom was heard abroad in all the country. Nothing remained long unknown to him, and it was as if the knowledge of hidden things was brought to him in the air. However, he had one curious custom. Every day at dinner, after the table had been cleared and every one gone away, a trusty servant had to bring in one other dish. But it was covered up, and the servant himself did not know what was in it, and no one else knew, for the King waited until he was quite alone before he uncovered it. This had gone on for a long time, but at last there came a day when the servant could restrain his curiosity no longer, but as he was carrying the dish away he took it into his own room. As soon as he had fastened the door securely, he lifted the cover, and there he saw a white snake lying on the dish. After seeing it he could not resist the desire to taste it, and so he cut off a small piece and put it in his mouth. As soon as it touched his tongue he heard outside his window a strange chorus of delicate voices. He went and listened, and found that it was the sparrows talking together, and telling each other all they had seen in the fields and woods. The virtue of the snake had given him power to understand the speech of animals.
Now it happened one day that the Queen lost her most splendid ring, and suspicion fell upon the trusty servant, who had the general superintendence, and he was accused of stealing it. The King summoned him to his presence, and after many reproaches told him that if by the next day he was not able to name the thief he should be considered guilty, and punished. It was in vain that he protested his innocence; he could get no better sentence. In his uneasiness and anxiety he went out into the courtyard, and began to consider what he could do in such a great necessity. There sat the ducks by the running water and rested themselves, and plumed themselves with their flat bills, and held a comfortable chat. The servant stayed where he was and listened to them. They told how they had waddled about all yesterday morning and found good food; and then one of them said pitifully,
""Something lies very heavy in my craw,—it is the ring that was lying under the Queen's window; I swallowed it down in too great a hurry.""
Then the servant seized her by the neck, took her into the kitchen, and said to the cook,
""Kill this one, she is quite ready for cooking.""
""Yes,"" said the cook, weighing it in her hand; ""there will be no trouble in fattening this one—it has been ready ever so long.""
She then slit up its neck, and when it was opened the Queen's ring was found in its craw. The servant could now clearly prove his innocence, and in order to make up for the injustice he had suffered the King permitted him to ask some favor for himself, and also promised him the place of greatest honor in the royal household.
But the servant refused it, and only asked for a horse and money for traveling, for he had a fancy to see the world, and look at him a little. So his request was granted, and he set out on his way; and one day he came to a pool of water, by which he saw three fishes who had got entangled in the rushes, and were panting for water. Although fishes are usually considered dumb creatures, he understood very well their lament that they were to perish so miserably; and as he had a compassionate heart he dismounted from his horse, and put the three fishes back again into the water. They quivered all over with joy, stretched out their heads, and called out to him,
""We will remember and reward thee, because thou hast delivered us."" He rode on, and after a while he heard a small voice come up from the sand underneath his horse's feet. He listened, and understood how an ant-king was complaining,
""If only these men would keep off, with their great awkward beasts! here comes this stupid horse treading down my people with his hard hoofs!""
The man then turned his horse to the side-path, and the ant-king called out to him,
""We will remember and reward thee!""
The path led him through a wood, and there he saw a father-raven and mother-raven standing by their nest and throwing their young ones out.
""Off with you! young gallows-birds!"" cried they; ""we cannot stuff you any more; you are big enough to fend for yourselves!"" The poor young ravens lay on the ground, fluttering, and beating the air with their pinions, and crying,
""We are poor helpless things, we cannot fend for ourselves, we cannot even fly! we can only die of hunger!""
Then the kind young man dismounted, killed his horse with his dagger, and left it to the young ravens for food. They came hopping up, feasted away at it, and cried,
""We will remember and reward thee!""
So now he had to use his own legs, and when he had gone a long way he came to a great town. There was much noise and thronging in the streets, and there came a man on a horse, who proclaimed,
""That the King's daughter seeks a husband, but he who wishes to marry her must perform a difficult task, and if he cannot carry it through successfully, he must lose his life.""
Many had already tried, but had lost their lives, in vain. The young man, when he saw the King's daughter, was so dazzled by her great beauty, that he forgot all danger, went to the King and offered himself as a wooer.
Then he was led to the sea-side, and a gold ring was thrown into the water before his eyes. Then the King told him that he must fetch the ring up again from the bottom of the sea, saying,
""If you come back without it, you shall be put under the waves again and again until you are drowned.""
Everyone pitied the handsome young man, but they went, and left him alone by the sea. As he was standing on the shore and thinking of what he should do, there came three fishes swimming by, none other than those he had set free. The middle one had a mussel in his mouth, and he laid it on the strand at the young man's feet; and when he took it up and opened it there was the gold ring inside! Full of joy he carried it to the King, and expected the promised reward; but the King's daughter, proud of her high birth, despised him, and set him another task to perform. She went out into the garden, and strewed about over the grass ten sacks full of millet seed.
""By the time the sun rises in the morning you must have picked up all these,"" she said, ""and not a grain must be wanting.""
The young man sat down in the garden and considered how it was possible to do this task, but he could contrive nothing, and stayed there, feeling very sorrowful, and expecting to be led to death at break of day. But when the first beams of the sun fell on the garden he saw that the ten sacks were all filled, standing one by the other, and not even a grain was missing. The ant-king had arrived in the night with his thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had picked up all the millet seed, and filled the sacks with great industry. The King's daughter came herself into the garden and saw with astonishment that the young man had performed all that had been given him to do. But she could not let her proud heart melt, but said,
""Although he has completed the two tasks, he shall not be my bridegroom unless he brings me an apple from the tree of life.""
The young man did not know where the tree of life was to be found, but he set out and went on and on, as long as his legs could carry him, but he had no hope of finding it. When he had gone through three kingdoms he came one evening to a wood, and seated himself under a tree to go to sleep; but he heard a rustling in the boughs, and a golden apple fell into his hand. Immediately three ravens flew towards him, perched on his knee, and said,
""We are the three young ravens that you delivered from starvation; when we grew big, and heard that you were seeking the golden apple, we flew over the sea to the end of the earth, where the tree of life stands, and we fetched the apple.""
Full of joy the young man set off on his way home, and brought the golden apple to the King's beautiful daughter, who was without any further excuse.
So they divided the apple of life, and ate it together; and their hearts were filled with love, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.",The White Snake.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/YuSvFqobLTsQG6g-XYCKYw/gLAcZ5I8DH99ohwdTN35Iml0gM8sQxVf30j4w3fRoAo1TNgPuekSji6bbD7sE2_PHhtxKcqvdemlJFiKuZNMbxRd3qgySVSO9Jf0xYxwkPg/XvXhA6hBqXKz6gFHajFOsysm8KmId0nas3G457ZK2Bo),425
You Never Can Tell,5,Poem,"You never can tell when you send a word,
Like an arrow shot from a bow
By an archer blind, be it cruel or kind,
Just where it may chance to go.
It may pierce the breast of your dearest friend.
Tipped with its poison or balm,
To a stranger's heart in life's great mart,
It may carry its pain or its calm.

You never can tell when you do an act
Just what the result will be;
But with every deed you are sowing a seed,
Though the harvest you may not see.
Each kindly act is an acorn dropped
In God's productive soil.
You may not know, but the tree shall grow,
With shelter for those who toil.

You never can tell what your thoughts will do,
In bringing you hate or love;
For thoughts are things, and their airy wings
Are swifter than carrier doves.
They follow the law of the universe—
Each thing must create its kind,
And they speed o'er the track to bring you back
Whatever went out from your mind.  ",You Never Can Tell.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Xb1eFOjpCv-cyvcUzaBeGg/L-TNYiIS2RC065qNwOCtxLUh0BIiPMatVvoMfG7nZmg6mM0tDuQymxvPp5oiry02lckR-cx6mqhsaA0UqcWn8Eb-semMcMMUXeNhm10i0eE/aLuZ2QLjERDOqJREyAL52hcfi1Q9iIgFQE8sqmNL_uk),426
Different Types of Natural Calamities,5,Informative Text,"Natural calamities refer to any natural event that causes significant destruction or harm to people and their property. Some of the most common types of natural disasters include earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, and wildfires.
Earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural disasters. They occur when two tectonic plates grind against each other, causing the ground to shake. Earthquakes can cause buildings to collapse, roads to crack, and landslides to occur. They can also trigger tsunamis, which can cause even more damage. Earthquakes can happen anywhere in the world, but they are most common in areas where tectonic plates meet, such as along the Pacific ""Ring of Fire.""
Hurricanes are another type of natural disaster that can cause significant destruction. They are tropical storms that form over warm ocean waters and can grow to be massive in size. Hurricanes can bring strong winds, heavy rain, and storm surges that can flood coastal areas. They can also cause landslides and tornadoes. Hurricanes are most common in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, but they can also happen in the Pacific Ocean and other parts of the world.
Tornadoes are another type of natural disaster that can cause significant destruction. They are rotating columns of air that can reach speeds of over 300 miles per hour. They can cause buildings to collapse, trees to be uprooted, and cars to be thrown around. Tornadoes are most common in the United States, particularly in the Midwest and the South.
Floods are another type of natural disaster that can cause significant destruction. They occur when there is too much water in an area and it overflows the banks of rivers or lakes. Floods can also happen when heavy rain causes water to collect in low-lying areas. Floods can cause buildings to collapse, roads to be washed away, and landslides to occur. They can also make it difficult for people to access clean drinking water.
Droughts are another type of natural disaster that can cause significant destruction. They occur when there is not enough water in an area for a long period of time. Droughts can cause crops to fail, which can lead to food shortages and famine. They can also make it difficult for people to access clean drinking water. Droughts are most common in desert regions, but they can also happen in other parts of the world.
Wildfires are another type of natural disaster that can cause significant destruction. They are large fires that can be caused by lightning strikes, human activity, or other factors. Wildfires can destroy buildings,
roads, and other infrastructure, and they can also cause air pollution. They are most common in areas with dry climates, such as California and Australia.
In conclusion, natural disasters can cause significant destruction and harm to people and their property. Some of the most common types of natural disasters include earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, and wildfires. Each of these natural disasters has its own unique characteristics and can happen in different parts of the world. It is important for people to be prepared for natural disasters by having emergency plans in place and by staying informed about the potential risks in their area.",Different Types of Natural Calamities.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/n9uyi2mrCv2MkGeGjowPcw/C7cn4aTDCyHc6SBFrj7K_meydrW4gcmVwWFWmb5N7IzWaXHolgdYpzYbz-72FUUYGBz6pTmLcXVDouP94jMOeU2LUbEO9JWVd6H4BAy0GjK9m1j4mChZx30qM_9rz7SO/yeg9tAcfKDfneIdwqt_ML6dT6WvywYOVxw4stEpQOBY),427
The Jar of Rosemary,5,Short Story ,"There was once a little prince whose mother, the queen, was sick. All summer she lay in bed, and everything was kept quiet in the palace; but when the autumn came she grew better. Every day brought color to her cheeks, and strength to her limbs, and by and by the little prince was allowed to go into her room and stand beside her bed to talk to her.
He was very glad of this for he wanted to ask her what she would like for a Christmas present; and as soon as he had kissed her, and laid his cheek against hers, he whispered his question in her ear.
""What should I like for a Christmas present?"" said the queen. ""A smile and a kiss and a hug around the neck; these are the dearest gifts I know.""
But the prince was not satisfied with this answer. ""Smiles and kisses and hugs you can have every day,"" he said, ""but think, mother, think, if you could choose the thing you wanted most in all the world what would you take?""
So the queen thought and thought, and at last she said: ""If I could take my choice of all the world, I believe a little jar of rosemary like that which bloomed in my mother's window when I was a little girl would please me better than anything else.""
The little prince was delighted to hear this, and as soon as he had gone out of the queen's room he sent a servant to his father's greenhouses to inquire for a rosemary plant.
But the servant came back with disappointing news. There were carnation pinks in the king's greenhouses, and roses with golden hearts, and lovely lilies; but there was no rosemary. Rosemary was a common herb and grew, mostly, in country gardens, so the king's gardeners said.
""Then go into the country for it,"" said the little prince. ""No matter where it grows, my mother must have it for a Christmas present.""
So messengers went into the country here, there, and everywhere to seek the plant, but each one came back with the same story to tell; there was rosemary, enough and to spare, in the spring, but the frost had been in the country and there was not a green sprig left to bring to the little prince for his mother's Christmas present.
Two days before Christmas, however, news was brought that rosemary had been found, a lovely green plant growing in a jar, right in the very city where the prince himself lived.
""But where is it?"" he said. ""Why have you not brought it with you? Go and get it at once.""
""Well, as for that,"" said the servant who had found the plant, ""there is a little difficulty. The old woman to whom the rosemary belongs did not want to sell it even though I offered her a handful of silver for it.""
""Then give her a purse of gold,"" said the little prince.
So a purse filled so full of gold that it could not hold another piece was taken to the old woman; but presently it was brought back. She would not sell her rosemary; no, not even for a purse of gold.
""Perhaps if your little highness would go by yourself and ask her, she might change her mind,"" said the prince's nurse. So the royal carriage drawn by six white horses was brought, and the little prince and his servants rode away to the old woman's house, and when they got there the first thing they spied was the little green plant in a jar standing in the old woman's window.
The old woman, herself, came to the door, and she was glad to see the little prince. She invited him in, and made him warm his hands by the fire, and gave him a cooky from her cupboard to eat.
She had a little grandson no older than the prince, but he was sick and could not run about and play like other children. He lay in a little white bed in the old woman's room, and the little prince, after he had eaten the cooky, spoke to him, and took out his favorite plaything, which he always carried in his pocket, and showed it to him.
The prince's favorite plaything was a ball which was like no other ball that had ever been made. It was woven of magic stuff as bright as the sunlight, as sparkling as the starlight, and as golden as the moon at harvest time. And when the little prince threw it into the air, or bounced it on the floor or turned it in his hands it rang like a chime of silver bells.
The sick child laughed when he heard it, and held out his hands for it, and the prince let him hold it, which pleased the grandmother as much as the child.
But pleased though she was she would not sell the rosemary. She had brought it from the home where she had lived when her little grandson's father was a boy, she said, and she hoped to keep it till she died. So the prince and his servants had to go home without it.
No sooner had they gone than the sick child began to talk of the wonderful ball.
""If I had such a ball to hold in my hand,"" he said, ""I would be content all day.""
""You may as well wish for the moon in the sky,"" said his grandmother; but she thought of what he said, and in the evening when he was asleep she put her shawl around her, and taking the jar of rosemary with her she hastened to the king's palace.
When she got there the servants asked her errand but she would answer nothing till they had taken her to the little prince.
""Silver and gold would not buy the rosemary,"" she said when she saw him; ""but if you will give me your golden ball for my little grandchild you may have the plant.""
""But my ball is the most wonderful ball that was ever made!"" cried the little prince; ""and it is my favorite plaything. I would not give it away for anything.""
And so the old woman had to go home with her jar of rosemary under her shawl.
The next day was the day before Christmas and there was a great stir and bustle in the palace. The queen's physician had said that she might sit up to see the Christmas Tree that night, and have her presents with the rest of the family; and every one was running to and fro to get things in readiness for her.
The queen had so many presents, and very fine they were, too, that the Christmas Tree could not hold them all, so they were put on a table before the throne and wreathed around with holly and with pine. The little prince went in with his nurse to see them, and to put his gift, which was a jewel, among them.
""She wanted a jar of rosemary,"" he said as he looked at the glittering heap.
""She will never think of it again when she sees these things. You may be sure of that,"" said the nurse.
But the little prince was not sure. He thought of it himself many times that day, and once, when he was playing with his ball, he said to the nurse:
""If I had a rosemary plant I'd be willing to sell it for a purse full of gold. Wouldn't you?""
""Indeed, yes,"" said the nurse; ""and so would any one else in his right senses. You may be sure of that.""
The little boy was not satisfied, though, and presently when he had put his ball up and stood at the window watching the snow which had come to whiten the earth for Christ's birthday, he said to the nurse:
""I wish it were spring. It is easy to get rosemary then, is it not?""
""Your little highness is like the king's parrot that knows but one word with your rosemary, rosemary, rosemary,"" said the nurse who was a little out of patience by that time. ""Her majesty, the queen, only asked for it to please you. You may be sure of that.""
But the little prince was not sure; and when the nurse had gone to her supper and he was left by chance for a moment alone, he put on his coat of fur, and taking the ball with him he slipped away from the palace, and hastened toward the old woman's house.
He had never been out at night by himself before, and he might have felt a little afraid had it not been for the friendly stars that twinkle in the sky above him.
""We will show you the way,"" they seemed to say; and he trudged on bravely in their light, till, by and by, he came to the house and knocked at the door.
Now the little sick child had been talking of the wonderful ball all the evening. ""Did you see how it shone, grandmother? And did you hear how the little bells rang?"" he said; and it was just then that the little prince knocked at the door.
The old woman made haste to answer the knock and when she saw the prince she was too astonished to speak.
""Here is the ball,"" he cried, putting it into her hands. ""Please give me the rosemary for my mother.""
And so it happened that when the queen sat down before her great table of gifts the first thing she spied was a jar of sweet rosemary like that which had bloomed in her mother's window when she was a little girl.
""I should rather have it than all the other gifts in the world,"" she said; and she took the little prince in her arms and kissed him.",The Jar of Rosemary .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/fxaV5pVhoPQzeLtEFgio6Q/efxxsoki_fpu2d44NutWw7QJkHNA_6UirWRzqrMoDDu_YhWFV7ntPihqBV3kQwMTWDe99C_ANkUFzC7CYFcwUFsQ19WB389TeRMdX3zQy9g/b2-4DIgksSplpjh922Rj1mZEgOPZivmMhoMjQNe5C9s),428
The Robber Kitten,5,Poem,"A kitten once to its mother said,
""I'll never more be good,
But I'll go and be a robber bold
And live in a dreary wood,
Wood, wood, wood,
And live in a dreary wood.""

So off he went to a dreary wood,
And there he met a cock,
And blew his head with a pistol off,
Which gave him an awful shock,
Shock, shock, shock,
Which gave him an awful shock.

Soon after that he met a cat.
""Now give to me your purse
Or I'll shoot you through and stab you, too,
And kill you—which is worse,
Worse, worse, worse,
And kill you—which is worse.""

At last he met a robber dog
And they sat down to drink;
The dog did joke and laugh and sing,
Which made the kitten wink,
Wink, wink, wink,
Which made the kitten wink.

At last they quarreled, then they fought
Beneath the greenwood tree,
And puss was felled with an awful club
Most terrible to see,
See, see, see,
Most terrible to see.

When puss got up his eye was cut
And swelled, and black and blue;
Moreover all his bones were sore,
Which made this kitten mew,
Mew, mew, mew.
Which made this kitten mew.

So up he got and rubbed his head,
And went home very sad.
""O mother dear, behold me here;
I'll never more be bad,
Bad, bad, bad,
I'll nevermore be bad.""",The Robber Kitten.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/00h8ohSf3NvxB-VA6vjgog/Xzwg0e7SjjuF9oCiHkDCjXEHJh5EUd8cDYlb32VpWJ2vvZsq32XRP2t4nkK9u4wzZ9OHK_y2VdBdNroRrCHm9MvNoLTt6tmq11LLd0M0X5g/jB3VU9KpCBELDGs-MZsf5c6zD0N3FWZ5CtiFvcnQD0Y),429

Atalanta,5,Short Story ,"Atalanta, daughter of the king of Arcadia, returned sad at heart to her own land. Only as comrades, as those against whose skill in the chase she was wont to pit her own skill, had she looked upon men. But Meleager, the hero who loved her and her fair honour more than life itself, and whose love had made him haste in all his gallant strength and youthful beauty to the land of the Shades, was one to touch her as never before had she been touched. Her father, proud of her triumph in Calydon, again besought her to marry one of her many noble suitors.
“If indeed they love me as thou sayest,” said Atalanta to her father, “then must they be ready to face for my sake even the loss of dear life itself. I shall be the prize of him who outruns me in a foot-race. But he who tries and fails, must pay to Death his penalty.”
Thereafter, for many days, a strange sight was to be seen in Arcadia. For one after another the suitors came to race with the maiden whose face had bewitched them, though truly the race was no more fair to him who ran than would be a race with Death. No mortal man was as fleet as Atalanta, who had first raced with the wild things of the mountains and the forests, and who had dared at last to race with the winds and leave even them behind. To her it was all a glorious game. Her conquest was always sure, and if the youths who entered in the contest cared to risk their lives, why should they blame her? So each day they started, throbbing hope and fierce determination to win her in the heart of him who ran—fading hope and despairing anger as he saw her skimming ahead of him like a gay-hued butterfly that a tired child pursues in vain. And each day, as the race ended, another man paid the price of his defeat.
Daily, amongst those who looked on, stood her cousin Milanion. He would fain have hated Atalanta for her ruthlessness and her joyousness as he saw his friends die for her sake, yet daily her beauty, her purity, and her gallant unconsciousness took a firmer hold upon his heart. To himself he vowed that he would win Atalanta, but not without help from the gods was this possible. Therefore he sought Aphrodite herself and asked her aid.
Milanion was a beautiful youth, and to Aphrodite, who loved beauty, he pled his cause as he told her how Atalanta had become to him more than life, so that he had ceased to pity the youths, his friends, who had died for love of her. The goddess smiled upon him with gentle sympathy.
In the garden of her temple grew a tree with branches and twigs of gold, and leaves as yellow as the little leaves of the silver birch when the autumn sun kisses them as it sets. On this tree grew golden apples, and Aphrodite plucked three of them and gave them to the youth who had not feared to ask her to aid him to win the maid he loved. How he was to use the apples she then told him, and, well content, Milanion returned home.
Next day he spoke to Atalanta.
“So far has victory been thine, Fairest on earth,” he said, “but so far have thy little winged white feet had only the heavy-footed laggards to outrun. Wilt have me run a race with thee? for assuredly I shall win thee for my own.”
And Milanion looked into the eyes of Atalanta with a smile as gay and fearless as that with which a hero is wont to look in the eyes of his fellow.
Look for look did the virgin huntress give him.
Then her cheeks grew red, as though the rosy-fingered dawn had touched them, and the dawning of love came into her heart.
Even Meleager was not quite so goodly a youth as this. Not even Meleager had been so wholly fearless.
“Thou art tempted by the deathless gods,” she said, but her long lashes drooped on her cheek as she spoke. “I pity you, Milanion, for when thou dost race with me, the goal is assuredly the meadows of asphodel near where sit Pluto and Persephone on their gloomy thrones.”
But Milanion said, “I am ready, Atalanta. Wilt race with me now?” And steadily he looked in her eyes until again they fell as though at last they had found a conqueror.
Like two swallows that skim across a sunny sea, filled with the joyousness of the coming of spring, Atalanta and Milanion started. Scarcely did their feet seem to touch the solid earth, and all those who stood by vowed that now, at length, was a race indeed, a race worthy for the gods to behold.
But as they ran, almost abreast, so that none could tell which was the gainer, Milanion obeyed the bidding of Aphrodite and let fall one of the golden apples. Never before had Atalanta dreamed of such a thing—an apple of glistening gold! She stopped, poised on one foot as a flying bird poises for a moment on the wing, and picked up the treasure. But Milanion had sped several paces ahead ere she was again abreast of him, and even as she gained on him, he dropped the second apple. Again Atalanta was tempted. Again she stopped, and again Milanion shot ahead of her. Her breath came short and fast, as once more she gained the ground that she had lost. But, yet a third time, Milanion threw in her way one of the golden illusions of the gods. And, yet again, Atalanta stooped to pick up the apple of gold.
Then a mighty shout from those who watched rent the air, and Atalanta, half fearful, half ashamed, yet wholly happy, found herself running, vanquished, into the arms of him who was indeed her conqueror. For not only had Milanion won the race, but he had won the heart of the virgin huntress, a heart once as cold and remote as the winter snow on the peak of Mount Olympus.",Atalanta.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/5RzrMDb60DsQcVdwtNx6pw/BJZ7qf2Qw3eqNaGzBN4SDNfLV-GAj_x_uJqUYSPlDQtEtI9pH-FaLIwQkNnl9OibGnIwDSd6RExFTmZU2wF9ypQxwTQoPJg-FYu6eM6bJdg/kxEpxYyeVLBZVq713wx-5Rr3K185Q_42y5STbrPdWik),431
Hunting Song,5,Poem,"Waken, lords and ladies gay!
On the mountain dawns the day;
All the jolly chase is here,
With hawk, and horse, and hunting spear!
Hounds are in their couples yelling,
Hawks are whistling, horns are knelling;
Merrily, merrily, mingle they,
‘Waken, lords and ladies gay.’

Waken, lords and ladies gay!
The mist has left the mountain grey,
Springlets in the dawn are steaming,
Diamonds on the brake are gleaming;
And foresters have busy been,
To track the buck in thicket green;
Now we come to chant our lay,
‘Waken, lords and ladies gay.’

Waken, lords and ladies gay!
To the greenwood haste away;
We can show you where he lies,
Fleet of foot, and tall of size;
We can show the marks he made,
When ’gainst the oak his antlers fray’d;
You shall see him brought to bay—
‘Waken, lords and ladies gay.’

Louder, louder chant the lay,
Waken, lords and ladies gay!
Tell them youth, and mirth, and glee,
Run a course as well as we;
Time, stern huntsman! who can baulk,
Stanch as hound, and fleet as hawk?

Creatures That Live in the Ocean,5,Informative Text,"The ocean is home to a diverse array of creatures, each with its own unique characteristics and adaptations that allow it to survive in its specific environment. From the smallest plankton to the largest whale, the ocean is teeming with life.
One of the most well-known groups of ocean creatures are fish. Fish come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny sardine to the massive whale shark. They can be found in every part of the ocean, from the surface to the depths. Fish have adapted to their environment in various ways, such as by developing bioluminescent abilities to attract prey or to communicate with others of their own kind. Some species of fish, such as the clownfish and the anglerfish, have developed the ability to change color to blend in with their surroundings and avoid predators.
Another group of ocean creatures that are quite diverse are marine mammals. These include whales, dolphins, porpoises, and seals. Marine mammals have adapted to living in the ocean in a number of ways. For example, whales have developed a thick layer of blubber to help keep them warm in the cold ocean water, while dolphins and porpoises have developed a streamlined body shape to help them swim quickly and efficiently. Marine mammals also have the ability to hold their breath for long periods of time, allowing them to dive to great depths in search of food.
Cephalopods, such as squids and octopuses, are also a diverse group of ocean creatures. They are known for their intelligence and their ability to change color and texture to blend in with their surroundings. Some species of cephalopods, such as the giant squid, can grow to be quite large, while others, such as the cuttlefish, are much smaller. Cephalopods have a variety of hunting strategies, such as using ink to distract their prey, or using their tentacles to capture and hold on to it.
Crustaceans, such as crabs and lobsters, are also found in the ocean. They have a hard exoskeleton to protect them from predators, and many species have developed claws that can be used for both hunting and defense. Crustaceans can be found in a variety of habitats, from the shallowest waters to the deepest parts of the ocean. Some species, such as the hermit crab, have adapted to living in shells or other hard structures for protection.
In addition to these well-known groups of ocean creatures, there are countless other species that are equally fascinating. From the bioluminescent comb jellies to the mysterious deep-sea anglerfish, the ocean is full of incredible creatures that are still being discovered and studied today.
In conclusion, the ocean is home to a vast array of creatures, each with its own unique characteristics and adaptations that allow it to survive in its specific environment. From the tiny plankton to the largest whale, the ocean is teeming with life. Each species plays an important role in the ocean's ecosystem and it's important to preserve and protect them. As we continue to learn more about these creatures and their behaviors, we can better understand and appreciate the diversity and complexity of life in the ocean.",Creatures That Live in the Ocean.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/4xgyaHqgAHL2WUJ-KdnMRQ/0lxANR7rJNTXNqZ8pIT_i0BUu9YTaPVDstUVndNwaJlNgBWjaXvCeuiROy-DGv2a4klOyW2JeT0FzSgnhe9CT7NOv1yQEvN1C3XxH9Y8dhFwMa8flw0Q1DBq4B7pMuDV/e4yyoHfVe2kh12thXFVpBxFRixqJn5OzbB375ykmgsM),433
Cat and Mouse in Partnership,5,Short Story ,"A cat, having made acquaintance with a mouse, professed such great love and friendship for her, that the mouse at last agreed that they should live and keep house together.
""We must make provision for the winter,"" said the cat, ""or we shall suffer hunger, and you, little mouse, must not stir out, or you will be caught in a trap.""
So they took counsel together and bought a little pot of fat. And then they could not tell where to put it for safety, but after long consideration the cat said there could not be a better place than the church, for nobody would steal there; and they would put it under the altar and not touch it until they were really in want. So this was done, and the little pot was placed in safety.
But before long the cat was seized with a great wish to taste it.
""Listen to me, little mouse,"" said he; ""I have been asked by my cousin to stand god-father to a little son she has brought into the world; he is white with brown spots; and they want to have the christening to-day, so let me go to it, and you stay at home and keep house.""
""Oh yes, certainly,"" answered the mouse, ""pray go by all means; and when you are feasting on all the good things, think of me; I should so like a drop of the sweet red wine.""
But there was not a word of truth in all this; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to stand god-father: he went to the church, straight up to the little pot, and licked the fat off the top; then he took a walk over the roofs of the town, saw his acquaintances, stretched himself in the sun, and licked his whiskers as often as he thought of the little pot of fat; and then when it was evening he went home.
""Here you are at last,"" said the mouse; ""I expect you have had a merry time.""
""Oh, pretty well,"" answered the cat.
""And what name did you give the child?"" asked the mouse.
""Top-off,"" answered the cat, dryly.
""Top-off!"" cried the mouse, ""that is a singular and wonderful name! is it common in your family?""
""What does it matter?"" said the cat; ""it's not any worse than Crumb-picker, like your god-child.""
A little time after this the cat was again seized with a longing.
""Again I must ask you,"" said he to the mouse, ""to do me a favor, and keep house alone for a day. I have been asked a second time to stand god-father; and as the little one has a white ring around its neck, I cannot well refuse.""
So the kind little mouse consented, and the cat crept along by the town wall until he reached the church, and going straight to the little pot of fat, devoured half of it.
""Nothing tastes so good as what one keeps to oneself,"" said he, feeling quite content with his day's work. When he reached home, the mouse asked what name had been given to the child.
""Half-gone,"" answered the cat.
""Half-gone!"" cried the mouse, ""I never heard such a name in my life! I'll bet it's not to be found in the calendar.""
Soon after that the cat's mouth began to water again for the fat.
""Good things always come in threes,"" said he to the mouse; ""again I have been asked to stand god-father, the little one is quite black with white feet, and not any white hair on its body; such a thing does not happen every day, so you will let me go, won't you?""
""Top-off, Half-gone,"" murmured the mouse, ""they are such curious names, I cannot but wonder at them!""
""That's because you are always sitting at home,"" said the cat, ""in your little gray frock and hairy tail, never seeing the world, and fancying all sorts of things.""
So the little mouse cleaned up the house and set it all in order. Meanwhile the greedy cat went and made an end of the little pot of fat.
""Now that everything is finished one's mind will be easy,"" said he, and came home in the evening, quite sleek and comfortable. The mouse asked at once what name had been given to the third child.
""It won't please you any better than the others,"" answered the cat. ""It is called All-gone.""
""All-gone!"" cried the mouse. ""What an unheard-of-name! I never met with anything like it! All-gone! whatever can it mean?"" And shaking her head, she curled herself round and went to sleep. After that the cat was not again asked to stand god-father.
When the winter had come and there was nothing more to be had out of doors, the mouse began to think of their store.
""Come, cat,"" said she, ""we will fetch our pot of fat, how good it will taste, to be sure!""
""Of course it will,"" said the cat, ""just as good as if you stuck your tongue out of the window!""
So they set out, and when they reached the place, they found the pot, but it was standing empty.
""Oh, now I know what it all meant,"" cried the mouse, ""now I see what sort of a partner you have been! Instead of standing god-father you have devoured it all up; first Top-off, then Half-gone, then""——
""Will you hold your tongue!"" screamed the cat, ""another word, and I devour you too!""
And the poor little mouse, having ""All-gone"" on her tongue, came out, and the cat leaped upon her and made an end of her. And that is the way of the world.",Cat and Mouse in Partnership.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/EDUHo_V3SiN0k9nT6itzwA/A5iXMUaWiDuZyVH08Zthk7Cc-iK4wRai5NiW5hKwMAezUYF_ckiQskm3ABGZC7x9R7agkJNwmYrmOt-hSdxc-zWPhXIMxwHorRxYsrP1_KPEYjWaw_183P_v3TDRXyzQ/37bvJC9f7DuB_umv7eC01lHjfRL2Xilsu7gIe69hUns),434
A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go,5,Poem,"A Frog he would a-wooing go,

Recycling Newspapers,5,Informative Text,"Recycling newspapers is an important step in reducing waste and preserving the environment. Not only does it save trees, but it also reduces the amount of energy needed to produce new paper products.
When newspapers are recycled, they are taken to a recycling facility where they are sorted and cleaned. The paper fibers are then broken down and mixed with water to create a slurry. This slurry is then spread out on a mesh screen and pressed to remove excess water. The remaining fibers are then dried and rolled into large bales. These bales are then transported to paper mills where they are used to create new paper products, such as newspapers, cardboard boxes, and paper bags.
Recycling newspapers can have a significant impact on the environment. The production of paper products is a major contributor to deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats. By recycling newspapers, we can reduce the demand for virgin wood pulp and help to preserve forests and the animals that depend on them.
In addition to the environmental benefits, recycling newspapers also has economic benefits. It can create jobs in the recycling and paper manufacturing industries, and it can save money on the cost of producing new paper products.
Despite the many benefits of recycling newspapers, it is still important to be mindful of how we consume and dispose of them. It is best to only buy what we need and to recycle them properly. Many areas have curbside recycling programs that make it easy to recycle newspapers, and it is also possible to drop them off at recycling centers.
In conclusion, recycling newspapers is an important step in reducing waste and preserving the environment. Not only does it save trees, but it also reduces the amount of energy needed to produce new paper products, creates jobs and saves money. It is important to be mindful of our consumption and to recycle them properly. By working together, we can make a positive impact on the environment and preserve our planet for future generations.",Recycling Newspapers.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/QGl5rrWBDf7Xb0kgU-rX2w/z-yNttRCZSXBiuS4yp_CPb5pYilYB2Fa4Zk15fagsaGUeyXh6fYQFXrZCuE8WzsAkerkk1oPzZdoMnBMyiqSthuRp_4ZsQPrkTLj6bvrks0/75XRd-znvm1DbJu_07SmIFQeONPOstqBwSNDDe-BO3o),436
The Enchanted Waterfall,5,Short Story ,"Once upon a time, there lived alone with his father and mother, a simple young wood-cutter. He worked all day on the lonely hillside, or among the shady trees of the forest. But, working as hard as he might, he was still very poor, and could bring home but little money to his old father and mother. This grieved him very much, for he was an affectionate and dutiful son.
For himself he had but few wants and was easily pleased. His mother, too, was always cheerful and content. The old father, however, was of a selfish disposition, and often grumbled at the poor supper of rice, washed down with weak tea, or, if times were very bad, with a cup of hot water.
""If we had but a little saké, now,"" he would say, ""it would warm one up, and do one's heart good."" And then he would reproach the simple young fellow, vowing that in his young days he had always been able to afford a cup of saké for himself and his friends.
Grieved at heart, the young man would work harder than ever and think to himself: ""How shall I earn some more money? How shall I get a little saké for my poor father, who really needs it in his weakness and old age?""
He was thinking in this way to himself one day as he was at work on the wooded hills, when the sound of rushing water caught his ear. He had often worked in the same spot before, and could not remember that there was any torrent or waterfall near. So, feeling rather surprised, he followed the sound, which got louder and louder until at last he came upon a beautiful little cascade.
The water looked so clear and cool that he stooped down where it was flowing away in a quiet stream, and, using his hand[300] as a cup, drank a little of it. What was his amazement to find that instead of water it was the most excellent saké!
Overjoyed at this discovery, he quickly filled the gourd which was hanging at his girdle, and made the best of his way home, rejoicing that now at last he had something good to bring back to his poor old father. The old man was so delighted with the saké that he drank cup after cup. A neighbor happened to drop in, the story was told to him, and a cup of saké was offered and drunk with many words of astonishment and gratitude.
Soon the news spread through the village, and before night there was hardly a man in the place who had not paid his visit out of curiosity, been told the tale of the magic fountain, and smelt the gourd, which, alas! was now empty.
Next morning the young wood-cutter set off to work earlier than usual, not forgetting to carry with him a large gourd, for of course the enchanted waterfall was to be visited again.
What was the surprise of the young man when he came to the spot, to find several of his neighbors already there, and all armed with buckets, jars, pitchers, anything that would carry a good supply of the coveted saké. Each man had come secretly, believing that he alone had found his way to the magic waterfall.
The young wood-cutter was amused to see the looks of disappointment and anger upon the faces of those who already stood near the water, as they saw fresh arrivals every moment. Each one looked abashed and uncomfortable in the presence of his neighbors; but, at last, one bolder than the others broke the grim silence with a laugh, which soon the others were fain to join in.
""Here we are,"" said he, ""all bent on the same errand. Let us fill our jars and gourds and go home. But first—just one taste of the magic saké."" He stooped down and, filling his gourd, put it to his lips. Once and yet again did he drink, with a face of astonishment which soon gave place to anger.[301]
""Water!"" he shouted in a rage; ""nothing but cold water! We have been tricked and deceived by a parcel of made-up stories—where is that young fellow? Let us duck him in his fine waterfall!""
But the young man had been wise enough to slip behind a big rock when he saw the turn things were taking, and was nowhere to be found.
First one and then another tasted of the stream. It was but too true; no saké, but clear, cold water was there. Crestfallen and out of temper, the covetous band returned to their homes.
When they were fairly gone the good young wood-cutter crept from his hiding-place. ""Could this be true,"" he thought, ""or was it all a dream? At any rate,"" said he, ""I must taste once more for myself."" He filled the gourd and drank. Sure enough, there was the same fine-flavored saké he had tasted yesterday. And so it remained. To the good, dutiful son the cascade flowed with the finest saké, while to all others it yielded only cold water.
The emperor, hearing this wonderful story, sent for the good young wood-cutter, rewarded him for his kindness to his father, and even changed the name of the year in his honor as an encouragement to children in all future time to honor and obey their parents.",The Enchanted Waterfall.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/at9iXt8D3z_0Ala47zF2hg/hv_YIkiND8jEKhX-tHPlvABZIC47i9fIb-YKsLbRs0CrWUDe6OSrS21dGH-g2f4JpxaD6suYJUWo7mMEEDgOWyIcloHEDk2zJQReOEb4l9tJAAzOdNhhVcVnx27afSve/arIdErv9yO8SueVBqfRq0BWcGBqhd5GOvYq0BIi5GmU),437
Grasshopper Green,5,Poem,"Grasshopper Green is a comical chap;
He lives on the best of fare.
Bright little trousers, jacket and cap,
These are his summer wear.
Out in the meadow he loves to go,
Playing away in the sun;
Its hopperty, skipperty, high and low—
Summer's the time for fun.

Grasshopper Green has a dozen wee boys,
And soon as their legs grow strong
Each of them joins in his frolicsome joys,
Singing his merry song.
Under the hedge in a happy row
Soon as the day has begun
It's hopperty, skipperty, high and low—
Summer's the time for fun.

Grasshopper Green has a quaint little house.
It's under the hedge so gay.
Grandmother Spider, as still as a mouse,
Watches him over the way.
Gladly he's calling the children, I know,
Out in the beautiful sun;
It's hopperty, skipperty, high and low—
Summer's the time for fun.",Grasshopper Green.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/ayw4J_jHdeg0_BnUe6gLjQ/grdgwq96GsdA8Lc7PzmFcm_sguDKXg5ZqoJah-vBRsWcrwqJlOAT-BjX5esIC55Tze8y3MM965I1gK1btRHvcJ8HOhvJ-K7aRAqQGsh_-rg/bT0VsU-mcjEeEg_FcRS6BzNVGw-JXjoGEweMs4Gz0ok),438
Covid-19 and Terms Related to It,5,Informative Text,"Covid-19, also known as the coronavirus disease, is a highly contagious respiratory illness that first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then, it has spread to every corner of the globe, leading to widespread illness and death, and causing significant disruptions to daily life and the global economy.
One of the key terms related to Covid-19 is ""social distancing."" This refers to the practice of maintaining a physical distance of at least six feet from others to reduce the risk of transmission. This can include measures such as working from home, closing schools and non-essential businesses, and canceling large gatherings.
Another important term is ""flattening the curve."" This refers to the idea that by reducing the number of new cases of Covid-19, the health care system can better handle the influx of patients and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. This can be achieved through social distancing, testing, contact tracing, and other measures.
""Contact tracing"" is another term that has become widely used in the context of Covid-19. This refers to the process of identifying and tracking the contacts of people who have tested positive for the virus in order to contain the spread of the disease.
""Quarantine"" and ""isolation"" are also important terms to know. Quarantine refers to the separation of people who have been exposed to the virus but do not yet have symptoms, while isolation refers to the separation of people who have tested positive for the virus or have symptoms.
""Vaccines"" are another important term related to Covid-19. Vaccines are a crucial tool in the fight against the virus, as they can protect individuals from severe illness and death, and help to slow the spread of the disease by creating herd immunity.
Overall, Covid-19 has brought a lot of new words and terms into our daily lives, but it is essential to have a basic understanding of these terms in order to protect ourselves and others from the virus.",Covid-19 and Terms Related to It.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/D7_-EkYsSdy4OVBmZo-gKw/mTN7X3KvLPDufltWa2JDPwL9jU_eMb-bJDPZ89VjeyRIUVeU97IeUErPcikiN1m-t9avBHaMrP-ZxmgC9ZtGtgxTHfQ5uesZp2lonTruVw-8yVkvOH1P6EESC9R5uwHz/xEXtNoLJmizpxJxd51S-SxqymAFxpd2ddGEZ0BvrdTo),439
George with the Goat,5,Short Story ,"There was a king who had a daughter who never could be induced to laugh; she was always sad. So the king proclaimed that she should be given to any one who could cause her to laugh. There was also a shepherd who had a son named George. He said: ""Daddy! I, too, will go to see whether I can make her laugh. I want nothing from you but the goat."" His father said, ""Well, go."" The goat was of such a nature that, when her master wished, she detained everybody, and that person was obliged to stay by her.
So he took the goat and went, and met a man who had a foot on his shoulder. George said: ""Why do you have a foot on your shoulder?"" He replied: ""If I take it off, I leap a hundred miles."" ""Whither are you going?"" ""I am going in search of a service, to see if any one will take me."" ""Well, come with us.""
They went on, and again met a man who had a bandage on his eyes. ""Why do you have a bandage on your eyes?"" He answered, ""If I remove the bandage, I see a hundred miles."" ""Whither are you going?"" ""I am going in search of a service, if you will take me."" ""Yes, I'll take you. Come also with me.""
They went on a bit farther, and met another fellow, who had a bottle under his arm, and, instead of a stopper, held his thumb in it. ""Why do you hold your thumb there?"" ""If I pull it out, I squirt a hundred miles, and besprinkle everything that I choose. If you like, take me also into your service; it may be to your advantage and ours too."" George replied: ""Well, come, too!""
Afterward they came to the town where the king lived, and bought a silken riband for the goat. They came to an inn, and orders had already been given there beforehand, that when such people came, they were to give them what they liked to eat and drink—the king would pay for all. So they tied the goat with that very riband and placed it in the innkeeper's room to be taken care of, and he put it in the side room where his daughters slept. The innkeeper had three maiden daughters, who were not yet asleep. So Manka said: ""Oh! if I, too, could have such a riband! I will go and unfasten it from that goat."" The second, Dodla, said: ""Don't; he'll find it out in the morning."" But she went anyway. And when Manka did not return for a long time, the third, Kate, said: ""Go, fetch her."" So Dodla went, and gave Manka a pat on the back. ""Come, leave it alone!"" And now she, too, was unable to withdraw herself from her. So Kate said: ""Come, don't unfasten it!"" Kate went and gave Dodla a pat on the petticoat; and now she, too, couldn't get away, but was obliged to stay by her.
In the morning George made haste and went for the goat, and led the whole set away—Kate Dodla, and Manka. The innkeeper was still asleep. They went through the village, and the judge looked out of a window and said, ""Fie, Kate! What's this? what's this?"" He went and took her by the hand, wishing to pull her away, but remained also by her. After this, a cowherd drove some cows through a narrow street, and the bull came rushing round; he stuck fast, and George led him, too, in the procession.
Thus they afterward came in front of the castle, and the servants came out-of-doors; and when they saw such things they went and told the king. ""Oh, sir, we have such a spectacle here; we have already had all manner of masquerades, but this has never been here yet."" So they immediately led the king's daughter to the square in front of the castle, and she looked and laughed till the castle shook.
Now they asked him what sort of person he was. He said that he was a shepherd's son, and was named George. They said that it could not be done; for he was of mean lineage, and they could not give him the damsel; but he must accomplish something more for them. He said, ""What?"" They replied that there was a spring yonder, a hundred miles off; if he brought a goblet of water from it in a minute, then he should obtain the damsel. So George said to the man who had the foot on his shoulder: ""You said that if you took the foot down, you could jump a hundred miles."" He replied: ""I'll easily do that."" He took his foot down, jumped, and was there. But after this there was only a very little time to spare, and by then he ought to have been back. So George said to the other: ""You said that if you removed the bandage from your eyes, you could see a hundred miles. Peep and see what is going on."" ""Ah, sir! Goodness gracious! He's fallen asleep!"" ""That will be a bad job,"" said George; ""the time will be up. You, the third man, said if you pulled your thumb out, you could squirt a hundred miles; be quick and squirt thither, that he may get up. And you, look whether he is moving, or what."" ""Oh, sir, he's getting up now; he's knocking the dust off; he's drawing the water."" He then gave a jump, and was there exactly in time.
After this they said that he must perform one task more; that yonder, in a rock, was a wild beast, a unicorn, of such a nature that he destroyed a great many of their people; if he cleared him out of the world he should obtain the damsel. So he took his people and went into the forest. They came to a firwood. There were three wild beasts, and three lairs had been formed by wallowing as they lay. Two did nothing: but the third destroyed the people. So they took some stones and some pine-cones in their pockets, and climbed up into a tree; and when the beasts lay down, they dropped a stone down upon that one which was the unicorn. He said to the next: ""Be quiet; don't butt me."" It said: ""I'm not doing anything to you."" Again they let a stone fall from above upon the unicorn. ""Be quiet! you've already done it to me twice."" ""Indeed, I'm doing nothing to you."" So they attacked each other and fought together. The unicorn wanted to pierce the second beast through; but it jumped out of the way, and he rushed so violently after it, that he struck his horn into a tree, and couldn't pull it out quickly. So they sprang speedily down from the fire, and the other two beasts ran away and escaped, but they cut off the head of the third, the unicorn, took it up, and carried it to the castle.
Now those in the castle saw that George had again accomplished that task. ""What, prithee, shall we do? Perhaps we must after all give him the damsel!"" ""No, sire,"" said one of the attendants, ""that cannot be; he is too lowborn to obtain a king's daughter! On the contrary, we must clear him out of the world."" So the king ordered them to note his words, what he should say. There was a hired female servant there, and she said to him: ""George, it will be evil for you to-day; they're going to clear you out of the world."" He answered: ""Oh, I'm not afraid. When I was only twelve years old, I killed twelve of them in one blow!"" But this was the fact: when his mother was baking a flat-cake, a dozen flies settled upon her, and he killed them all at a single blow.
When they heard this, they said: ""Nothing else will do but we must shoot him."" So they drew up the soldiers, and said they would hold a review in his honor, for they would celebrate the wedding in the square before the castle. Then they conducted him thither, and the soldiers were already going to let fly at him. But George said to the man who held his thumb in the bottle in the place of a stopper: ""You said, if you pulled your thumb out, you could besprinkle everything. Pull it out—quick!"" ""Oh, sir, I'll easily perform that."" So he pulled out his thumb and gave them all such a sprinkling that they were all blind, and no one could see.
So, when they perceived that nothing else was to be done, they told him to go, for they would give him the damsel. Then they gave him a handsome royal robe, and the wedding took place. I, too, was at the wedding; they had music there, sang, ate, and drank; there was meat, there were cheesecakes, and baskets full of everything, and buckets full of strong waters. To-day I went, yesterday I came; I found an egg among the tree-stumps; I knocked it against somebody's head, and gave him a bald place, and he's still got it.",George with the Goat.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/XxWa7y-xiiXO5CRg-8PDaw/yrOA4GPbNayDZjC9gjb9L5XiPhOQCrq2c-0fyvBElfuSiPwPvbo7yJgBucP9MDYr756PwAQSTb4DimzyDghtTcw5EsgoE32BVDkdejPmzCo/wLNxFVpXpx9dJkWMYXEHMH1N6ZIHpzPNrlkNy73A21s),440
The Children's Hour,5,Poem,"Between the dark and the daylight,
   When the night is beginning to lower,
Comes a pause in the day's occupations,
   That is known as the Children's Hour.

I hear in the chamber above me
   The patter of little feet,
The sound of a door that is opened,
   And voices soft and sweet.

From my study I see in the lamplight,
   Descending the broad hall stair,
Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra,
   And Edith with golden hair.

A whisper, and then a silence:
   Yet I know by their merry eyes
They are plotting and planning together
   To take me by surprise.

A sudden rush from the stairway,
   A sudden raid from the hall!
By three doors left unguarded
   They enter my castle wall!

They climb up into my turret
   O'er the arms and back of my chair;
If I try to escape, they surround me;
   They seem to be everywhere.

They almost devour me with kisses,
   Their arms about me entwine,
Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen
   In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine!

Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,
   Because you have scaled the wall,
Such an old mustache as I am
   Is not a match for you all!

I have you fast in my fortress,
   And will not let you depart,
But put you down into the dungeon
   In the round-tower of my heart.

And there will I keep you forever,
   Yes, forever and a day,
Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,
   And moulder in dust away!",The Children's Hour.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/tHfuxUim8-bfrCrVRo9FmA/CTtvwKRzSAEhCo8PNgtg6lo27O104NhRtP1iiawI3tZJYS9jt0B5SYctgKYQK4W9DXa93vNv2kREV3bt7iqxYfx2HUEGvp3bHyodThr219U/MTRqGGLCHpD-DD8YmSUhyAjlp1KdCtGjUmqhS6VMQEE),441
Planets of the Solar System,5,Informative Text,"The solar system is made up of eight planets that orbit around the sun. These planets are unique in their own ways and have fascinated scientists and people for centuries. In this composition, we will take a detailed look at each planet and explore its characteristics and properties.
Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and is also the smallest planet in the solar system. It is only about a third the size of Earth and has a very thin atmosphere. Mercury's surface is covered in craters and is heavily cratered. It is also home to the largest crater in the solar system, the Caloris Basin. Mercury has a very slow rotation, taking 59 days to complete one rotation. This means that a day on Mercury is much longer than a day on Earth.
Venus is the second planet from the sun and is the brightest object in the sky after the sun and the moon. It is often referred to as the Earth's sister planet because it is similar in size and composition to Earth. However, Venus has a thick atmosphere that is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, which causes a greenhouse effect that makes the surface of the planet extremely hot. The temperature on Venus can reach up to 864 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. Venus also has a thick layer of clouds that are mostly made up of sulfuric acid.
Earth is the third planet from the sun and is the only known planet to have life. It has a diverse range of environments, from the frozen Arctic tundra to the hot deserts of Africa. Earth has a diverse range of flora and fauna, and has a unique atmosphere that is able to support life. The atmosphere is made up of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gasses. Earth also has a magnetic field which helps to protect it from harmful solar radiation.
Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and is often referred to as the red planet because of its reddish appearance. Mars has a thin atmosphere and a surface that is covered in dust and rocks. The planet has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the largest canyon, Valles Marineris. Scientists have long been interested in Mars because it has a similar environment to Earth and could potentially support life.
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and is the largest planet in the solar system. Jupiter is a gas giant, which means that it is mostly made up of gas and has no solid surface. Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field and a very large number of moons, including the four largest moons in the solar system: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Jupiter also has a very large storm, the Great Red Spot, that has been raging for over 350 years.
Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and is the second largest planet in the solar system. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant and has no solid surface. Saturn is famous for its rings, which are made up of ice and rock particles. Saturn has many moons, including the largest moon in the solar system, Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury.
Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is the third largest planet in the solar system. Uranus is also a gas giant and has no solid surface. Uranus is tilted on its axis by 98 degrees, which means that it rotates on its side. Uranus has a number of moons and a number of ring systems.
Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is a gas giant, similar in size and composition to Uranus. It has a pale blue color and is named after the Roman god of the sea. It has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. The planet has a very active atmosphere, with large storms and strong winds. Its atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with some methane, which gives it its blue color. It has a very long year, lasting about 165 Earth years.

A Wasted Life,5,Short Story ,"One of the handsomest, bravest, richest, and most talented young men of Athens was Alcibiades. When he was five years old his father was killed in battle. The men who brought up the boy allowed him to have his own way in everything, so that he grew to be very stubborn and selfish.
One day he was playing in the street when a chariot came driving up.
""Stop!"" said Alcibiades to the driver. ""You shall not pass this way. Stop, I tell you!""
""Who are you?"" replied the driver. ""By what right do you stop me? I shall certainly pass this way.""
The boy threw himself in front of the wheel of the chariot. ""Now drive on if you dare!"" he cried. ""Drive over my body and see what will happen to you!""
Of course the driver had to stop but Alcibiades was much to blame for such behavior.
He was wrestling with a playmate and was likely to be thrown. He bit the boy, who said, ""O Alcibiades, that is not fair! You bite like a woman.""
""No,"" he answered, ""I bite like a lion!""
When he was eighteen years old his fortune was given into his own hands. He spent much money on dress, and even his iron shield was inlaid with gold and ivory. The young men of Athens tried to be like him. He spoke with a lisp; so did they. They combed their hair as he combed his, and wore clothes like those he wore. They drank and gambled with him and were proud when people said, ""There go the friends of Alcibiades.""
But with all his faults he was not idle. He studied oratory and philosophy that he might be able to speak well and reason rightly. One of his teachers was the wise Socrates, who tried to help him to be good. He liked the philosopher and while under his care behaved very well. They went to war side by side and in one of the battles Alcibiades was wounded. Then Socrates stood over him and kept away his enemies until help came and carried the wounded youth to a place of safety.
At another time Socrates with his troop was running from the enemy and was in great danger. But Alcibiades, who was on horseback, rode down those foes and saved his friend.
In the company of the wise and good this young man seemed to be like them, but with companions of his own age he was the leader in everything wrong and wicked.
He delighted in sports. Once he took seven chariots to the Olympic games and put them all into the races. With them he won the first, second, and fourth prizes.
Because he spent his money freely and provided amusement for the people he was very popular. He spoke in public meetings, fought in the army, and was a leading citizen before he was thirty years old.
He was greatly in favor of a war against Sicily, by which he thought the glory and power of Athens would be much increased. A fleet was made ready and was about to sail with him as leader when a strange thing happened.
In Athens, at the crossings of the larger streets, busts of the god Hermes had been set up. One morning it was found that nearly every one of these was injured. From some the heads had been broken off, from others the noses or the ears had been knocked away. The people were frightened and angry. The god and the city had been insulted. The cry was raised that this was the work of Alcibiades and his drunken young companions. Yet in the midst of this outcry the fleet sailed with him as one of its commanders.
His enemies at home said he must be called back to answer for his crime. He escaped from the fleet, went to Sparta, told the plans of the Athenians, and did all he could to help the enemies of his native city.
Although absent from Athens he was tried there, found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. The state took all his property and the priests solemnly cursed him in their temples.
He lived in Sparta for several years and seemed like one of the people of that land. He dressed plainly, ate coarse food, exercised every day in the gymnasium, and gave the rulers good and helpful advice. But some people did not trust him and he heard that the king of Sparta had ordered him to be put to death. He fled to the camp of Tissaphernes, a Persian general. There he made himself so agreeable that the Persian was never happy without him.
After a while the Athenian army passed a vote that Alcibiades should be pardoned and recalled and made one of their generals. He was invited to return, was made a leader, and by his help several victories were gained.
The records of his banishment were then sunk in the sea, his property was given back to him, he was blessed in those temples where he had been cursed; and all the forces, by land and sea, were placed under his command.
In the very next battle he was defeated. He was disgraced and could no longer be leader. He fled to his castle in Thrace, hired soldiers, made war on the Thracians, and helped the Greek cities.
Persia, Sparta, and Athens agreed together that he must die. He had gone to the house of a friend, a woman named Timandra. Soldiers who had been sent against him surrounded the house and set it on fire. He rushed out with his sword in his hand but he was shot with many arrows, and fell to rise no more.
Timandra gave him an honorable burial but at the funeral she was the only mourner. He had been false to himself and to everybody else, and nobody was sorry when he died, not yet forty years old.",A Wasted Life.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/vNkX4aBwYPonRLUq8-N4Fw/D667gUQ-YKr9q5b1eZlOxkZ6vJDWx5rVawJ2nK2sZb2KVONSxEsG0Wdd_ULbiN0bcvrBqSGn659SmiPvCyP358aQ1vtO3VTfsgxgmAVNyaI/zYPtYKWKiHqYaqUcfdJSIttBCeg2H2kQXbxDdz2J8bc),443

The Difference  between Bacteria and Virus,5,Informative Text,"Bacteria and viruses are both microorganisms that can cause illness in humans, but they are very different from each other.
Bacteria are single-celled organisms that have a cell wall and can be found all over the world, including in soil, water, and inside our bodies. They can be helpful, such as when they aid in digestion or produce antibiotics, or harmful, such as when they cause infections. Bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics, which are drugs that kill or stop the growth of bacteria.
Viruses, on the other hand, are not considered living organisms because they cannot reproduce on their own. They need to infect a host cell, such as a human cell, to replicate. Unlike bacteria, viruses do not have a cell wall and are much smaller in size. They can cause a wide range of illnesses, from the common cold to more serious diseases such as HIV and COVID-19. Unlike bacterial infections, viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics. Instead, treatment often involves relieving symptoms and allowing the body’s immune system to fight off the virus.
Another key difference between bacteria and viruses is how they spread. Bacteria can spread through contact with an infected person or contaminated surface, as well as through food or water. Viruses, on the other hand, primarily spread through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through contact with contaminated surfaces.
It is also important to note that not all bacteria are harmful and not all viruses are deadly, in fact many of them are beneficial for us. For example, bacteria in our gut help us to digest our food and produce important vitamins. Some viruses, like bacteriophages, can be used to control bacterial infections.
To sum up, bacteria and viruses are both microorganisms that can cause illness, but they are very different in terms of their structure, reproduction, and how they spread. Bacteria are single-celled organisms that have a cell wall and can be treated with antibiotics, while viruses are not considered living organisms, do not have a cell wall, and can only be treated with symptom relief and allowing the body’s immune system to fight off the virus.
It is important to maintain good hygiene and take preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection from both bacteria and viruses, such as washing your hands regularly, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and getting vaccinated against certain viral infections.",The Difference  between Bacteria and Virus.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/aV9wYd3vmVNur2oBK3Q2sQ/6fBH6YWPDofxqEtlwUBMlpP9IoqLVJVBYb7-NVFrkI5wz4IHVfMkOwdEUmlbT0V477TCtyfTOAeYUFYouQ1CDxACjFV7zpOF1eADSLwletS3dnK7MdxwRiKuk8DI2bgl/Y27Aaawom_l2BmGdTKgM4OaJuJFtSS3rzdbNxlnulr0),445
The Golden Lion,5,Short Story ,"There was once a rich merchant who had three sons, and when they were grown up the eldest said to him, ‘Father, I wish to travel and see the world. I pray you let me.’
So the father ordered a beautiful ship to be fitted up, and the young man sailed away in it. After some weeks the vessel cast anchor before a large town, and the merchant’s son went on shore.
The first thing he saw was a large notice written on a board saying that if any man could find the king’s daughter within eight days he should have her to wife, but that if he tried and failed his head must be forfeit.
‘Well,’ thought the youth as he read this proclamation, ‘that ought not to be a very difficult matter;’ and he asked an audience of the king, and told him that he wished to seek for the princess.
‘Certainly,’ replied the king. ‘You have the whole palace to search in; but remember, if you fail it will cost you your head.’
So saying, he commanded the doors to be thrown open, and food and drink to be set before the young man, who, after he had eaten, began to look for the princess. But though he visited every corner and chest and cupboard, she was not in any of them, and after eight days he gave it up and his head was cut off.
All this time his father and brothers had had no news of him, and were very anxious. At last the second son could bear it no longer, and said, ‘Dear father, give me, I pray you, a large ship and some money, and let me go and seek for my brother.’
So another ship was fitted out, and the young man sailed away, and was blown by the wind into the same harbor where his brother had landed.
Now when he saw the first ship lying at anchor his heart beat high, and he said to himself, ‘My brother cannot surely be far off,’ and he ordered a boat and was put on shore.
As he jumped onto the pier his eye caught the notice about the princess, and he thought, ‘He has undertaken to find her, and has certainly lost his head. I must try myself, and seek him as well as her. It cannot be such a very difficult matter.’ But he fared no better than his brother, and in eight days his head was cut off.
So now there was only the youngest at home, and when the other two never came he also begged for a ship that he might go in search of his lost brothers. And when the vessel started a high wind arose, and blew him straight to the harbor where the notice was set.
‘Oho!’ said he, as he read, ‘whoever can find the king’s daughter shall have her to wife. It is quite clear now what has befallen my brothers. But in spite of that I think I must try my luck,’ and he took the road to the castle.
On the way he met an old woman, who stopped and begged.
‘Leave me in peace, old woman,’ replied he.
‘Oh, do not send me away empty,’ she said. ‘You are such a handsome young man you will surely not refuse an old woman a few pence.’
‘I tell you, old woman, leave me alone.’
‘You are in some trouble?’ she asked. ‘Tell me what it is, and perhaps I can help you.’
Then he told her how he had set his heart on finding the king’s daughter.
‘I can easily manage that for you as long as you have enough money.’
‘Oh, as to that, I have plenty,’ answered he.
‘Well, you must take it to a goldsmith and get him to make it into a golden lion, with eyes of crystal; and inside it must have something that will enable it to play tunes. When it is ready, bring it to me.’
The young man did as he was bid, and when the lion was made the old woman hid the youth in it, and brought it to the king, who was so delighted with it that he wanted to buy it. But she replied, ‘It does not belong to me, and my master will not part with it at any price.’
‘At any rate, leave it with me for a few days,’ said he; ‘I should like to show it to my daughter.’
‘Yes, I can do that,’ answered the old woman; ‘but to-morrow I must have it back again. And she went away.
The king watched her till she was quite out of sight, so as to make sure that she was not spying upon him; then he took the golden lion into his room and lifted some loose boards from the floor. Below the floor there was a staircase, which he went down till he reached a door at the foot. This he unlocked, and found himself in a narrow passage closed by another door, which he also opened. The young man, hidden in the golden lion, kept count of everything, and marked that there were in all seven doors. After they had all been unlocked the king entered a lovely hall, where the princess was amusing herself with eleven friends. All twelve girls wore the same clothes, and were as like each other as two peas.
‘What bad luck!’ thought the youth. ‘Even supposing that I managed to find my way here again, I don’t see how I could ever tell which was the princess.’
And he stared hard at the princess as she clapped her hands with joy and ran up to them, crying, ‘ Oh, do let us keep that delicious beast for to-night; it will make such a nice plaything.’
The king did not stay long, and when he left he handed over the lion to the maidens, who amused themselves with it for some time, till they got sleepy, and thought it was time to go to bed. But the princess took the lion into her own room and laid it on the floor.
She was just beginning to doze when she heard a voice quite close to her, which made her jump. ‘O lovely princess, if you only knew what I have gone through to find you!’ The princess jumped out of bed screaming, ‘The lion! the lion!’ but her friends thought it was a nightmare, and did not trouble themselves to get up.
‘O lovely úprincess!’ continued the voice, ‘fear nothing! I am the son of a rich merchant, and desire above all things to have you for my wife. And in order to get to you I have hidden myself in this golden lion.’
‘What use is that?’ she asked. ‘For if you cannot pick me out from among my companions you will still lose your head.’
‘I look to you to help me,’ he said. ‘I have done so much for you that you might do this one thing for me.’
‘Then listen to me. On the eighth day I will tie a white sash round my waist, and by that you will know me.’
The next morning the king came very early to fetch the lion, as the old woman was already at the palace asking for it. When they were safe from view she let the young man out, and he returned to the king and told him that he wished to find the princess.
‘Very good,’ said the king, who by this time was almost tired of repeating the same words; ‘but if you fail your head will be the forfeit.’
So the youth remained quietly in the castle, eating and looking at all the beautiful things around him, and every now and then pretending to be searching busily in all the closets and corners. On the eighth day he entered the room where the king was sitting. ‘Take up the floor in this place,’ he said. The king gave a cry, but stopped himself, and asked, ‘What do you want the floor up for? There is nothing there.’
But as all his courtiers were watching him he did not like to make any more objections, and ordered the floor to be taken up, as the young man desired. The youth then want straight down the staircase till he reached the door; then he turned and demanded that the key should be brought. So the king was forced to unlock the door, and the next and the next and the next, till all seven were open, and they entered into the hall where the twelve maidens were standing all in a row, so like that none might tell them apart. But as he looked one of them silently drew a white sash from her pocket and slipped it round her waist, and the young man sprang to her and said, ‘This is the princess, and I claim her for my wife.’ And the king owned himself beaten, and commanded that the wedding feast should be held.
After eight days the bridal pair said farewell to the king, and set sail for the youth’s own country, taking with them a whole shipload of treasures as the princess’s dowry. But they did not forget the old woman who had brought about all their happiness, and they gave her enough money to make her comfortable to the end of her days.",The Golden Lion.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/-xmSK3Sn7FfZh8pVh0_zLw/6X5RiJiQhiZo1UgC3qELGEhqGzK0jum_pUYYS37xjwY2dVU9pIVmEPt4VnXku1M1JwfoZp633oujSPVVkZMXadLSauMFRcMmQWZNGayFWsE/H4YdizdnEF_Uva0EdkpiWC6N98hCDenbYsqtlm6hdi8),446
Columbus,5,Poem,"Behind him lay the gray Azores,
Behind the gates of Hercules;
Before him not the ghost of shores,
Before him only shoreless seas.
The good mate said: ""Now must we pray,
For lo! the very stars are gone;
Speak, Admiral, what shall I say?""
""Why say, sail on! and on!""

""My men grow mut'nous day by day;
My men grow ghastly wan and weak.""
The stout mate thought of home; a spray
Of salt wave wash'd his swarthy cheek.
""What shall I say, brave Admiral,
If we sight naught but seas at dawn?""
""Why, you shall say, at break of day:
'Sail on! sail on! and on!'""

They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow,
Until at last the blanch'd mate said;
""Why, now, not even God would know
Should I and all my men fall dead.
These very winds forget their way,
For God from these dread seas is gone.
Now speak, brave Admiral, and say——""
He said: ""Sail on! and on!""

They sailed, they sailed, then spoke his mate:
""This mad sea shows his teeth to-night,
He curls his lip, he lies in wait,
With lifted teeth as if to bite!
Brave Admiral, say but one word;
What shall we do when hope is gone?""
The words leaped as a leaping sword:
""Sail on! sail on! and on!""

Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,
And thro' the darkness peered that night.
Ah, darkest night! and then a speck,—
A light! a light! a light! a light!
It grew—a star-lit flag unfurled!
It grew to be Time's burst of dawn;
He gained a world! he gave that world
Its watch-word: ""On! and on!""",Columbus.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/nyw9BrzNdzcwdbfhErLX4Q/4FGaBvpjofnAGLE-93gcHq8wqRYaocXnm-JpZd1mKSg3mSZ0X2jRppqoOLJvEmwDaNSskFl3Qy0ALEbM0tHqX_8tZng9HsPAfZrBn4_tBBU/XepBe_Nj1FYUATb21Jo6IcBJVpA4iEX-bDUj7lnjtpk),447
Water Pollution,5,Informative Text,"Water pollution is a serious problem that affects the environment and human health. It occurs when harmful substances, such as chemicals, microorganisms, and waste, are introduced into bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and groundwater. This can have a negative impact on the plants and animals that live in these bodies of water, as well as the people who rely on them for drinking water, irrigation, and recreation.
One of the main causes of water pollution is industrial waste. Factories and power plants often release large amounts of chemicals, such as heavy metals and oil, into the water. These pollutants can be toxic to fish, birds, and other wildlife, and can also make the water unsafe for human consumption.
Another major source of water pollution is agricultural runoff. When farmers use pesticides and fertilizers on their crops, these chemicals can wash into nearby bodies of water. This can lead to the growth of harmful algae and bacteria, which can deplete the oxygen levels in the water and make it difficult for fish and other aquatic life to survive.
Sewage is another major contributor to water pollution. When sewage is not properly treated, it can release harmful bacteria and viruses into the water. This can make the water unsafe for swimming and other activities, and can also lead to the spread of diseases.
There are also many human activities that can lead to water pollution. For example, people may dispose of trash, oil, and chemicals into the water. This can harm the plants and animals that live in the water and make the water unsafe for human use.
To help reduce water pollution, it is important for individuals and communities to take action. This can include properly disposing of waste and chemicals, reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and promoting the use of sustainable farming practices. It is also important for industries to reduce the amount of pollutants they release into the water, and for governments to enforce regulations to ensure that companies and individuals are held accountable for their actions.
Overall, water pollution is a serious problem that affects the environment and human health. By taking action and working together, we can help to reduce the amount of pollutants in our water and ensure that our bodies of water remain clean and safe for generations to come.",Water Pollution.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/2wbd-qkqmjr77Z48TN2jkQ/BcFxx8YfYNBi-zjrJKVBgNaGMr3pswCmSr6MzCFhlgJAQvvUxiRROYu1z_dE14fFV4e46tkokOjQRL1ZhSsok-m0Yp70GWAdrcA1eIeoBrs/G_8N-HXwfkHjwSPBAKG2KcCTUeae5xJ950hNYr0-OJ4),448
The House in the Wood,5,Short Story ,"A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the borders of a great forest. One morning as he was going to his work, he said to his wife, ‘Let our eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the woods; and so that she shall not lose her way, I will take a bag of millet with me, and sprinkle the seed on the path.’
When the sun had risen high over the forest, the girl set out with a basin of soup. But the field and wood sparrows, the larks and finches, blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago, and the girl could not find her way.
She went on and on, till the sun set and night came on. The trees rustled in the darkness, the owls hooted, and she began to be very much frightened. Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between the trees. ‘There must be people living yonder,’ she thought, ‘who will take me in for the night,’ and she began walking towards it.
Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows. She knocked at the door, and a gruff voice called, ‘Come in!’ The girl stepped into the dark entrance, and tapped at the door of the room.
‘Just walk in,’ cried the voice, and when she opened the door there sat an old gray-haired man at the table. His face was resting on his hands, and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground.
By the stove lay three beasts, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow. The girl told the old man her story, and asked for a night’s lodging.
The man said:
     Pretty cock,
     Pretty hen,
     And you, pretty brindled cow,
     What do you say now?
‘Duks,’ answered the beasts; and that must have meant, ‘We are quite willing,’ for the old man went on, ‘Here is abundance; go into the back kitchen and cook us a supper.’
The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen, and cooked a good meal, but she did not think of the beasts. She placed the full dishes on the table, sat down opposite the gray-haired man, and ate till her hunger was appeased. When she was satisfied, she said, ‘But now I am so tired, where is a bed in which I can sleep? ‘
The beasts answered:
     You have eaten with him,
     You have drunk with him,
     Of us you have not thought,
     Sleep then as you ought!
Then the old man said, ‘Go upstairs, and there you will find a bedroom; shake the bed, and put clean sheets on, and go to sleep.’ The maiden went upstairs, and when she had made the bed, she lay down. After some time the gray-haired man came, looked at her by the light of his candle, and shook his head. And when he saw that she was sound asleep, he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar.
The woodcutter came home late in the evening, and reproached his wife for leaving him all day without food. ‘No, I did not,’ she answered; ‘the girl went off with your dinner. She must have lost her way, but will no doubt come back to-morrow.’ But at daybreak the woodcutter started off into the woods, and this time asked his second daughter to bring his food.
‘I will take a bag of lentils,’ said he; ‘they are larger than millet, and the girl will see them better and be sure to find her way.’ At midday the maiden took the food, but the lentils had all gone; as on the previous day, the wood birds had eaten them all. The maiden wandered about the woods till nightfall, when she came in the same way to the old man’s house, and asked for food and a night’s lodging.
The man with the white hair again asked the beasts:
     Pretty cock,
     Pretty hen,
     And you, pretty brindled cow,
     What do you say now?
The beasts answered, ‘Duks,’ and everything happened as on the former day. The girl cooked a good meal, ate and drank with the old man, and did not trouble herself about the animals.
And when she asked for a bed, they replied:
     You have eaten with him
     You have drunk with him,
     Of us you have not thought,
     Now sleep as you ought!
And when she was asleep, the old man shook his head over her, and let her fall into the cellar. On the third morning the woodcutter said to his wife, ‘Send our youngest child to-day with my dinner. She is always good and obedient, and will keep to the right path, and not wander away like her sisters, idle drones!’
But the mother said, ‘Must I lose my dearest child too?’ ‘Do not fear,’ he answered; ‘she is too clever and intelligent to lose her way. I will take plenty of peas with me and strew them along; they are even larger than lentils, and will show her the way.’
But when the maiden started off with the basket on her arm, the wood pigeons had eaten up the peas, and she did not know which way to go. She was much distressed, and thought constantly of her poor hungry father and her anxious mother. At last, when it grew dark, she saw the little light, and came to the house in the woods. She asked prettily if she might stay there for the night, and the man with the white beard asked his beasts again:
     Pretty cock,
     Pretty hen,
     And you, pretty brindled cow,
     What do you say now?
‘Duks,’ they said. Then the maiden stepped up to the stove where the animals were lying, and stroked the cock and the hen, and scratched the brindled cow between its horns.
And when at the bidding of the old man she had prepared a good supper, and the dishes were standing on the table, she said, ‘Shall I have plenty while the good beasts have nothing? There is food to spare outside; I will attend to them first.’
Then she went out and fetched barley and strewed it before the cock and hen, and brought the cow an armful of sweet-smelling hay. ‘Eat that, dear beasts,’ she said,’ and when you are thirsty you shall have a good drink.’
Then she fetched a bowl of water, and the cock and hen flew on to the edge, put their beaks in, and then held up their heads as birds do when they drink, and the brindled cow also drank her fill. When the beasts were satisfied, the maiden sat down beside the old man at the table and ate what was left for her. Soon the cock and hen began to tuck their heads under their wings, and the brindled cow blinked its eyes, so the maiden said, ‘Shall we not go to rest now?’
     Pretty cock,
     Pretty hen,
     And you, pretty brindled cow,
     What do you say now?
The animals said, ‘Duks:
     You have eaten with us,
     You have drunk with us,
     You have tended us right,
     So we wish you good night.’ 
The maiden therefore went upstairs, made the bed and put on clean sheets and fell asleep. She slept peacefully till midnight, when there was such a noise in the house that she awoke. Everything trembled and shook; the animals sprang up and dashed themselves in terror against the wall; the beams swayed as if they would be torn from their foundations, it seemed as if the stairs were tumbling down, and then the roof fell in with a crash. Then all became still, and as no harm came to the maiden she lay down again and fell asleep. But when she awoke again in broad daylight, what a sight met her eyes! She was lying in a splendid room furnished with royal splendor; the walls were covered with golden flowers on a green ground; the bed was of ivory and the counterpane of velvet, and on a stool nearby lay a pair of slippers studded with pearls. The maiden thought she must be dreaming, but in came three servants richly dressed, who asked what were her commands. ‘Go,’ said the maiden, ‘I will get up at once and cook the old man’s supper for him, and then I will feed the pretty cock and hen and the brindled cow.’
But the door opened and in came a handsome young man, who said, ‘I am a king’s son, and was condemned by a wicked witch to live as an old man in this wood with no company but that of my three servants, who were transformed into a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow. The spell could only be broken by the arrival of a maiden who should show herself kind not only to men but to beasts. You are that maiden, and last night at midnight we were freed, and this poor house was again transformed into my royal palace.
As they stood there the king’s son told his three servants to go and fetch the maiden’s parents to be present at the wedding feast.
‘But where are my two sisters?’ asked the maid.
‘I shut them up in the cellar, but in the morning they shall be led forth into the forest and shall serve a charcoal burner until they have improved, and will never again suffer poor animals to go hungry.’",The House in the Wood.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/Bu1pBvPUj_9qHvuvL_Xqbw/DUXmaMwzN4U3i5OjLOO_r4npw03G78XYwNASS9j-apLYyKDIYqqCqel6WE5qqu_BUuIZqejAcHswiRY-PhQlmeAjREdnlOFJqZYWBtWsS14/LEdnIKrAGKMItv4jo1WPQsbf4ghpm0aA587jlLiFNKY),449
Abou Ben Adhem,5,Poem,"Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,
An angel writing in a book of gold.

Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold;
And to the presence in the room he said,
""What writest thou?"" The vision raised its head,
And, with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, ""The names of those who love the Lord.""

""And is mine one?"" said Abou. ""Nay, not so,""
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said, ""I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.""

The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night
It came again, with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed;
And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.",Abou Ben Adhem .png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1677168000000/JjpcSG7kgB826SigCXKwdA/ro_LcWiYYXcJiH88kmmzlGMdLPyXV2hkId6H6mrJHfFJ1CPoUZfKQfmxzyPxickXzI-BxUGoGE3t-WwHtPWG-JdM9d3j1s9zEChK5V_Zf_g/G8iA3hK1OXW_ka6C7MdMnsTizWDpYYS1bSV_hLu_2WU),450
